- In your case start with 5% in the Roth TSP to get the match, then start working on maxing out a Roth IRA, then back to the TSP.
- Usually, people invest into their 401k up to the company match, and then their IRA to the max, and then back to the 401k to the max. The reason they do this is because the average 401k usually has higher fees than their IRA does, but leaving free money (the match) on the table would be stupid; hence the match, IRA, back to 401k.

Former optician here!

I highly recommend polycarbonate lenses (as opposed to a basic plastic lens- also known as CR) they are more durable and naturally scratch-resistant and have UV protection. When I worked as an optician, we could only add UV and scratch resistant coatings to a basic plastic lens.

High Index Lenses are typically better suited for prescriptions under - 2 but of course that is up to your personal preference. Some frames are not well-suited to high index lenses.

Anti-Reflective Coating helps reduce glare from nighttime driving, computer screens and helps reduce eye fatigue. If your eyes are sensitive to changes in light it is worth the cost.

Transitions/tinting is completely personal preference. Just be aware most transitions are NOT polarized the way normal sunglasses are.

If you have any other questions I’d be happy to help :)

    if (autoSave.length % 10 === 0 && autoSave.length !== 0) {
        handleState(event);
    }
}

onBlur={(event) => handleState(event.target.value)};
onChange={(event) => stateAutoSave(event.target.value)};

// Without autosave.
