# APPLICATION COPYPASTA

Dealing with students tutoring in computer science as well as getting a Bachelor's in computer science is relative to the position. I'm always learning and studying new technologies which compasses what this company is about, innovation.

Greetings! I'm AC and I'm eager to pursue this opportunity provided! Open to relocation! (If you have me of course, I'm all for meeting people and collaboration, that's the fun part of developing a product!)

My previous experience reflects creating a product and going through the process of creating well-designed, testable code that my colleagues can use. I'm always learning and studying new technologies which compasses what this company is about, innovation.

Any technical questions that related to the company, as if you were building a specific component the company would used as not only was it challenging, but it felt like I was working at the company even for a brief while.

There a million ways technical interviewing could be better. Instead of 1 interviewer, several interviewers, different thought processes. An option to take a certain question instead of stick to one specific one, or maybe a combination of all the questions in bite sizes. A conversation with a friend tends to show more than a conversation with a stranger.
