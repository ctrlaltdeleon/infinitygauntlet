# Introduction

## Software Engineer interviews: Everything you need to prepare

1. Maximize your chances of being shortlisted
2. Find out the interview format
3. Pick a programming language
4. Sharpen your Computer Science fundamentals for interviews
5. Practice for the coding interview
6. Prepare for the systems design interview (for mid/senior levels)
7. Prepare for the behavioral interview
8. Negotiating the offer package

### Maximize your chances of being shortlisted

- Make the best resume.
- Literally only thing emphasized.

### Find out the interview format

1. Quiz (Occasional)
   1. What is 4 & 5 (in binary)?
      1. Answer: 4
   2. What is the time complexity of bubble sort?
      1. Answer: O(n2)
2. Online coding assessment (Occasional)
   1. Questions usually are to implement a function with a specific input to a specific output.
3. Take home assignment (Rare)
   1. Seen with startups and < 100 employee companies.
   2. May implement a web page or how one navigates a task.
4. Phone screen interviews (Common)
   1. A question will be given to you and you will work on that question using an online collaborative editor.
5. Onsite (Always)
   1. Multiple rounds (coding, system design, behavioral) and is expected to last for a few hours.

### Pick a programming language

- The most common programming languages used for coding interviews are Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.

### Study and practice for coding interviews

- While Cracking the Coding Interview is a great resource, I prefer learning by actually solving problems.
- LeetCode = interview prep.
- HackerRank, CodeForces = competitive programming.

#### Coding interview study plan

- The recommended time period to set aside for coding interview preparation is 3 months (11 hours a week i.e. 2-3 hours a day) for a more holistic preparation.
- [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) generates recommended study plans for coding interviews based on the time you have left.

#### Resources to use in your practice

1. Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions
2. AlgoMonster
3. My (free) coding interview best practices guide
4. My (free) coding interview techniques guide
5. My (free) algorithms study guide

#### Try out mock coding interviews (with Google and Facebook engineers)

- [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) is currently the best mock technical interview resource in the market currently.
  - It allows you to book mock coding interviews with real Google and Facebook engineers, albeit anonymously.
  - You could even book interviews for specific roles like Mobile, Front End, Engineering Management.
  - Even better - if you want to have an easier transition into real world coding interview - you could view recorded interviews and see what phone interviews are like.

### Prepare for the system design interview

- If you are a mid or senior-level candidate, you may expect system design questions as part of your technical interview.
- The objective of system design interviews is to evaluate a candidate's skill at designing real-world software systems involving multiple components.
- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)

### Prepare for the behavioral interview

- As much as these interviews seem "fluffy" or unstructured, there is actually a structured way to prepare for behavioral interviews.

#### Know the STAR format for answering them

- Situation: Share details about the situation that gave rise to the task.
  - We needed to implement a feature that allowed users to filter through different entries.
- Task: Explain what you needed to achieve or the problems you had to solve, focusing on the scope, severity or specific benchmarks or outcomes you had to hit.
  - In order to do so, we made an outline of types of filters we'd like to develop such as time filters, entry filters, and text filters.
- Action: Explain what you did to meet your objectives, describing options you had and how you made decisions.
  - We implemented to filter foundation initially while implementing each filter one by one.
- Results: Describe the outcome of your actions and what you learnt.
  - We were able to make filters.

#### Practice the most common behavioral questions for software engineers

- Covered later on.

### Negotiating the software engineer offer package

# Getting an interview

## Practical guide to writing FAANG-ready software engineer resumes

1. Set up an ATS-friendly resume template
2. Fill up your template with well-framed content in a meaningful order
3. Optimize your resume with prioritization and keywords
4. Test out resume using free tools

### How to set up an ATS-friendly software engineer resume

- Something most candidates may not realize is that most top tech companies are using some form of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to parse and screen thousands of resumes even before they reach human eyes.

#### Only use Microsoft Word or Google Docs to create and edit your resume

- Do:
  - Submit your resume as a PDF file to preserve formatting, but always create it from Microsoft Word or Google Docs. It is important to ensure that the text in your resume is easily highlightable, which is a precondition for easy parsing.
  - ATS tools are always trying to improve their readability of standard resume formats - hence the more commonplace your resume format is, the better.
  - To maximize space on your resume, rather than using header or footers, reduce the margins of the page - narrow margins are 0.5 on each side.
- Don't:
  - Do not use Photoshop, other graphic design tools or online resume builders to build your resume.
  - Do not use the header or footer sections in a Word/Google Docs file - reduce margins instead and just write the information in the body.

#### Only use standard fonts of readable sizes
