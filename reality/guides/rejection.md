# Rejection

Thank you for the opportunity to interview and the consideration!

I’m sorry to hear that the decision did not go as I wanted, but I appreciate the care and thoroughness shown to me during my interview. It was a pleasure to meet everyone and learn everyone’s perspectives.

For my own growth, is there any feedback that can be given to me from the interview process?

Thank you again!
