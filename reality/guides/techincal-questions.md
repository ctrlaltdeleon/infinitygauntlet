# Technical Questions

## What is the difference between "arguments" and "parameters" when dealing with functions?

- Arguments are what is given to a function such as "Andrew".
- Parameters are what a function takes such as "name".
- Parameters are what are expected, arguments are what it is.

## Why use Object Oriented Programming?

- Encapsulation.
  - Reduce complexity + increase resuability.
  - Charmander is hungry. You can `feed()` Charmander, but you can't change how hungry the Charmander is directly because that's private properties.
- Inheritance.
  - Eliminate redundant code.
  - Charizard inherits Charmander's traits and moves, no need to recreate.
- Polymorphism.
  - Refactor ugly switch/case statements.
  - Charizard can use `flamethrower()` like Charmander, but a different version called `fireBlast()`.
