# Star Method

“Tell me about a time when you performed well under enormous pressure.”

1. SITUATION: One time, at my last job, my coworker had a family emergency and needed to miss work for some time, and their super-important project was left unfinished and without a manager.
2. TASK: My supervisor instructed me to take on the project, and with no leniency on the deadline, I had days to complete a project that originally should have taken several weeks.
3. ACTION: I requested and was granted a reduction in my weekly goals, allotting me more time to attack the special project. As far as my weekly goals, I was able to delegate them out evenly to some of my teammates.
4. RESULT: With the reduction in my daily goals, I was able to dedicate more time to the special project. This allowed me to finish it on time and with complete accuracy. My supervisor appreciated my attitude and drive, and I was given several more projects after that, along with an eventual promotion and pay raise.

"Tell me about a time where you had to create a new project." (OWNERSHIP)
"What’s the most innovative new idea that you have implemented?" (LEARN AND BE CURIOUS)

1. SITUATION: I was put onto a team as the front-end lead on a new project.
2. TASK: The goal was to simmer out the details of which front-end technologies we would use (React, ReactContext, SocketIO).
3. ACTION: I set up a demo to showcase how one would develop with these technologies, folder structure, syntax.
4. RESULT: As a result, this led to my proposal being accepted, me taking time to learn and mentor other engineers of the technologies. Personally, it was quite daunting being hired on immediately and being ask to be the front-end lead, but after obstacles and so forth, I managed to learn a lot, learn how to communicate effectively, and felt like this was a product I made.

"Tell me about a time where you handled a difficult situation." (DELIVER RESULTS)

1. SITUATION: Recently, I switched to another team in respects of meeting deadlines and making sure the sponsor's needs were met adequately.
2. TASK: My new team instructed me to take on creating parsers for the project in order to have data be delivered promptly for the sponsors. I had to learn new technologies regarding data science and the original code base in a short amount of time.
3. ACTION: I spoke with the team, whom my mentor was, spoke with my mentor about setting up my environment, took some time to analyze the code, learn python, and whenever I had questions I would ask my mentor.
4. RESULT: This led to getting up to speed on a project within a week, identifying the scope of my tasks, and being autonomous to the project without too much hand holding.

"Tell me about a time you had to quickly adjust your work priorities to meet changing demands." (BIAS FOR ACTION)

1. SITUATION: Our team sent out a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) to the sponsors and the testing group to have this be prepared for fleet installation.
2. TASK: While working on features at the time, the team had to shift to fixing breaking bugs.
3. ACTION: Instead of one of us tackling a bug and the rest working on features, we all pair-programmed. This made sense at the time since features weren't priority if bugs existed. We wanted to give the fleet a working product bug-free, instead of a more featured bugged product.
4. RESULT: This led to making sure bugs were fixed, considering different inputs, outputs, and so if this bug occurs again, we'd all be prepared for it for the next time.

"What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals?" (TEAMWORK)
"Describe a situation when you negotiated with others in your organization to reach an agreement." (TEAMWORK)
"Tell me about a time you stepped up into a leadership role." (OWNERSHIP)
"Describe a time when you sacrificed short term goals for long term success." (OWNERSHIP)

1. SITUATION: One year into our project, the state management from the front-end perspective was all over the place and led to more time developing on tasks and more upkeep.
2. TASK: We had to choose either keep the code base as is or implement a global state management system, which was Redux. This took convincing, especially for the PM, because we wanted to make sure the outcome of this change was tangible in the future.
3. ACTION: We chose the latter.
4. RESULT: Although we spent up more time learning Redux and pushing features out, we thought at the time this was reasonable as the next shipped product wasn't for a few months and lead us to more efficient standards of developing. I felt proud of this change cause I really wanted to own the product and make sure future developers did not have to struggle.

"Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?" (TEAMWORK)
"The last time you had to apologize to someone." (TEAMWORK)

1. SITUATION: There was a conflict where my development branch was merged to master and although we peer reviewed the code review together, this led to the CI/CD being broken.
2. TASK: I had accidentally blocked everyone from completing their tasks and had to fix this as soon as possible.
3. ACTION: To remedy this situation best from my perspective, what I did was let everyone know the situation of the CI/CD pipeline, rewind master to the previous merge, analyzed the CI/CD pipeline, fixed the issue.
4. RESULT: This led to the sprint being resumed normally, but biggest take away was to communicate the situation to the team.

"Tell me about a time when you received negative feedback from your manager. How did you respond?" (EARN TRUST)
"Tell me about a time you had to deal with ambiguity." (STRATEGY)
"Tell me about a time when you were not able to meet a time commitment. What prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it." (FAILURE)
"Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned from it. (FAILURE)

1. SITUATION: There are times when I spend a while on a task due to searching for a optimized solution on several StackOverflow posts and it showed I was diving too deep on certain topics.
2. TASK: My manager spoke to me about leaving the task alone for someone else to pick up, but I wanted to compromise a middle ground.
3. ACTION: The action I took was to set a time I would take dissecting a task and solutions, usually an hour, and if the research becomes stale, I go with the initial solution, implement it, and ask my team about the solution either in code review.
4. RESULT: This led to me being more productive and not rabbit holed into a task. There's definitely a balance here, but I was able to showcase progress to my manager and earn their trust.

"Tell me about a time when you missed an obvious solution to a problem." (DIVE DEEP)

1. SITUATION: There was a problem when accessing a specific database after it was deprecated where it wasn't populating certain values when being called.
2. TASK: The task was to figure out why this did so and how to replicate the bug since it was hard to reproduce.
3. ACTION: I wrote down different scenarios, tested them, and saw if the functionality was working correctly or if the bug was reproducible.
4. RESULT: I found the outlier in the code and was just making sure to check the state of the application correctly which then it turn making sure I pass a key-value to the conditional to properly display the component.

"A time when you faced a problem that had multiple possible solutions." (DIVE DEEP)

1. SITUATION: I was given a task to fix a look and feel of a certain text field implemented in one of our parent components.
2. TASK: I could either manually go through each child component and fix the CSS and state management manually having custom abilities for each one, I could search for an alternate solution such as a modal pop up, or I could make a reusable component for the implemented solution.
3. ACTION: I went ahead and made this robust reusable component specifically for scrolling text fields.
4. RESULT: This led to the code being reinvented and simplified with less noise and easy customization through providing arguments to many parameters if specified.

"Tell me about a time when you had to push back to HQ or challenged a decision." (OWNERSHIP)
"We all deal with difficult customers from time to time. Tell me about a challenging client-facing situation and how you handled it." (CUSTOMER OBSESSION)

1. SITUATION: Our sponsors reviewed our product and made comments on the look and feel about it, but wasn't too specific on the details.
2. TASK: Specifically one of those things was how to deal with unknowns and what to display for them.
3. ACTION: It was hard to gain a clear goal from the sponsors so what I had did along with the team was create a document of what it means if specific keys and unknown and what it should show.
4. RESULT: This led to unambiguous terminology across the application and a clear bulletin board of what to reference when a task approaches this issue.
