# Communication Lingo

## Communication

- "is there extra pay since i'm doing more?"
  - with my role expanding is there a plan to review my title and compensation to better reflect these responsibilities
- "that sounds like a you problem"
  - i believe that falls within your scope of responsibilities, but i'm happy to support where it makes sense
- "why didn't you ask me for this sooner?"
  - given the tight deadline it would have been beneficial to have been looped on this sooner
- "stop emailing me so often"
  - to ensure that information does not get lost, let's reduce frequency of communication so that updates are only provided once more details have been established

## Rejection

Thank you for the opportunity to interview and the consideration!

I’m sorry to hear that the decision did not go as I wanted, but I appreciate the care and thoroughness shown to me during my interview. It was a pleasure to meet everyone and learn everyone’s perspectives.

For my own growth, is there any feedback that can be given to me from the interview process?

Thank you again!
