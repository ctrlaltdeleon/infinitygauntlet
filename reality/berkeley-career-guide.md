### 1: Preparing for Your Search

- Find out who you are, what you like, what strengths you have.
- Conduct informational interviews to figure it out more.
- Informational Interview:
  - Informal conversation with someone working in an area of interest to you who is willing to give you information about a job, career field, industry, or work setting.
  - It is not a job interview and the objective is not to find job openings.

### 1.1: Initiate Contact

- Contact the person by email, phone, or letter.
- Mention how you found out about them so it's not creepy.
- Emphasize what you're looking for information or a job.

```
Dear person...

I am so-so doing so-so...

I am currently looking for a job in these certain careers...
I would greatly appreciate 15 to 20 minutes of your time speaking about...

Thank you for your consideration...

Sincerely,
Name
```

### 1.2: Prepare for an Interview

- Develop a 30 second overview to introduce yourself, including reasons for contacting this person.
- Keep questions open ended instead of binary.

```
Greetings, I'm AC, graduated from SDSU with a Bachelor's in Computer Science...
What's the tech stack that you work with and what do you like about it?
```

### 1.3: Conduct the Informational Interview

- Dress appropriately.
- Restate your objective.
- Take notes, ask for a card, ask for other people to talk to.

  - Keep in touch, tell them how things are going.
  - This relationship could become an important part of your professional network.

- Be aware of your social network presence.

    - Even if you weren't paid for a job or experience, be sure to list it.
    - These experiences can be very valuable.
  - Skills:
    - Add the skills you have developed that are relevant to the types of positions you are/will be seeking. (Recruiter insider tip: Do not lead off this list with MS Word – it is assumed you have this skill if you are in college!)
  - Projects:
    - Highlight relevant class or personal projects you have worked on.
    - Provide photos, links, videos, documents, etc that provided deeper insight into these projects.
  - Recommendations:
    - Ask managers, professors, or classmates who've worked with you closely to write a recommendation.
    - This gives extra credibility to your strengths and skills.
  - Join Groups:
    - By joining groups in your industries of interest you can meet other professionals, alumni, etc who share common interests.
    - You can learn a lot about your interest areas, including industry trends and news, by connecting to people and groups in LinkedIn.

  - Opportunities to adventure out
- If it helps, draw it out, rank what you want and what you don't want.
- "Can I ask for more time?"
  - Yes, but be prepared to explain why and how much time you need.
  - A company who really wants you will speed up their process if possible.

  - Be respectful for their time.
  - Let them know what's on your mind.
- "What are exploding offers?"

    - Signing bonuses only to people who accept immediately.
    - First-come, first-served basis.
- "I forgot to respond to a company!"
  - Do not renege on an offer!
  - Companies spend tons of money to recruit you so if you ignore the companies when they commit to you, you not only damage the company, but you also damage other applicants and yourself through networking you've done.

### 6.2: Negotiation

- Entry-level employees do not usually have a lot of latitude for negotiation.
- Some employers have leeway to negotiate salary pay while others do not.
- Keep in mind the job market for your specific career when negotiating!
  - Is it overcrowded or is it slow?
- Basic Salary Negotiation Principles:
  - Research the market salary range for your experience level and for the career role.
  - Think about the location you're going to live as certain places may pay more, but the cost of living is more in return. (Essentially think about relativity in terms of cost)
  - Public VS Private!
    - Public usually has pre-determined salary while private companies will depend on several factors such as education, technical skills, and experience.
  - Don't prematurely talk about salary, let them speak about it unless you have a clear understanding of the job.
  - If you have to reveal your salary, do a range instead of a set number.
  - When you get an offer, ask for it in writing and ask the employer to clarify any aspects that aren't clear to you.
  - Be both assertive and cooperative.
  - If you are successful in your negotiation, ask for a new offer letter that reflects any changes.
- "What else can I negotiate?"
  - Start date.
  - Early performance review and salary review.
  - Vacation.
  - Professional development.
  - Relocation expenses.
  - Flex time.
  - Signing bonus.
  - Performance bonus.
- Always practice negotiating with friends, family, or career counselor.
- Always be enthusiastic and respectful.

### 6.3: Accepting an Offer

- Sign and send it back to the employer by the agreed upon deadline.
- Keep a copy of the letter for future reference.
- If your application is pending with other employers, let them know that you have received an offer and wish to have your name withdrawn from further consideration.
- It is unethical to continue interviewing once you have accepted an offer.
- Inform your references and other contacts of your job or internship status.
- Thank them and periodically update them on your career trajectory.

```

I am delighted to accept the offer to join...
I look forward to...
From my understanding, the salary will be...
Also these expenses will be covered as well...

### 6.4: Declining an Offer

- Contact the employer formally by email and indicate your appreciation for the offer and the opportunity to interview.
- State that you are declining their offer.
- You may tell them why, although you are not required to do so.
- Decline offers as soon as you are no longer interested in them or immediately after accepting an offer from another organization.
