# Review

TECHNICAL: Andrew is a professional Software Engineer, new to the center, and is key to the successful execution of YEEHAW. He functions as a User Experience Engineer, and is responsible for designing and implementing the GUI to best execute YEEHAW. Andrew has also recently been learning how other portions of the code work, enabling him to become a Full Stack developer, significantly improving YEEHAW throughput. Andrew rarely needs assistance with code structuring and construction, he has hit the ground running on YEEHAW Development.

TEAMWORK/COMMUNICATION: Andrew is frequent and valued contributor with his Frontend React Framework expertise. His contributions to the implemented Frontend User experience has garnered significant praise from the sponsor. Andrew participates in YEEHAW meetings and is comfortable expressing himself and providing input to the shared project goal. He has improved his collaboration capabilities with other team members to ensure his and other's development isn't blocked during task execution.

MANAGEMENT: Andrew is being mentored by senior engineers on YEEHAW, and also mentors others. He has led meetings and become an integral team member. Andrew manages his own time and resources well, and doesn't hesitate to ask for help. He has not interacted with customers, but he did generate the demonstration videos that were universally praised by the sponsor.

LEADERSHIP: Andrew is a reliable software engineer. He is constantly learning and looking for ways to improve his skillset, including volunteering to be part of the initial Full Stack training efforts on YEEHAW. He occasionally leads meetings and encourages others to grow as leaders, team members, and developers. Andrew is an effective, reliable engineer. His work is excellent and timely. His continued work on YEEHAW is important and integral to the success of ONI's vision to improve submarine user's lives. Andrew learns quickly and has significant expertise with Frontend Frameworks to leverage to the benefit of YEEHAW and the team. He takes direction and follows plans for the project. Andrew often goes out of his way to get ahead of upcoming tasking and provide useful input to assist in planned development. He has already made an impact on the design and implementation of the YEEHAW GUI that will improve the project, primarily on maintaining a consistent look and feel. Andrew is an eager learner and easy to work with, making him an asset on the YEEHAW project. Andrew rarely needs help with code construction and management, and is taking mentorship well and making great strides. He is now a Full Stack developer, significantly increasing YEEHAW development throughput by allowing him to easily move between multiple code bases and components of YEEHAW. Andrew is a significant asset to the team, making a bigger impact than would be expected for such a junior developer.

TECHNICAL:

- Scope/Impact:
  Designed and built software to produce an auto generating Basic Mission Report (BMR) for submarines known as the BMR Reconstruction Tool (YEEHAWRT). Integrating this software into submarine hardware known as YEEHAWROCK has enhanced the Navy's ability to maintain logistics of missions. Deployed YEEHAWRT to multiple submarines garnering positive feedback within the last year. Coordinated with the YEEHAWMAGIC team to complete parsers for 100+ clients.

- Complexity/Difficulty:
  With no prior knowledge of the software, implemented Redux, a software library that manages and centralizes an application's state, which will cut costs by reduce manual labor, reduce code duplication, and enable improved developer cycles on tasking. Implemented data science techniques on YEEHAWMAGIC while having no knowledge of technologies, quickly adapting to the task.

- Independence:
  Fully updated the team's development environments with latest and greatest patches, bug fixes, and quality of life updates to the software used to develop for YEEHAWRT which overall leads to implement updated features, reduce code complexity, and improve stability and speed of the application. Able to create full fledged parsers independently after min. guidance.

- Creativity:
  Implemented a software status indicator for YEEHAWRT to enable the user to identify if there are problems with connections to the software. This benefits users of YEEHAWRT by reducing risk of mistakes and ripple mistakes as well as improving communication within the submarine such as identifying where the proof of error is.

TEAMWORK AND COMMUNICATION:

- Scope of Team Effort:
  Represented NIWC Pacific at the UCI UAI Scholars Conference by giving my experiences and thoughts of being a software engineer as well as answering any questions inspired from students who pursue the path thus contributing to NIWC Pacific hiring goals.

- Contribution to Team:
  Continued to contribute to YEEHAWRT by being on-site majority of the time despite the global pandemic. Ready to help the YEEHAWRT team on issues through pair programming which increases team collaboration and discussion.

- Team Effectiveness:
  Proactively help out YEEHAWRT team members whenever one is stuck on a task in order to finish tasks at a pace to reduce task blockage and increase developer cycles on future tasks. Was mission essential to the development of YEEHAWRT during the global pandemic.

- Level of Interaction:
  Presented YEEHAWRT at the NP Poster Session to all of NIWC Pacific and senior leadership, which promotes teamwork, awareness, and collaboration across departments.

- Communication:
  Updated technical documentation guides for specific contingencies within the YEEHAWRT software, in order to have these guides as blueprints for saving time for future developers as well as the existing YEEHAWRT team.

MANAGEMENT:

- Scope of Resource Responsibility:
  Trained and certified as a open and close access technician to the lab, ensuring the safety and security of classified projects as well as giving access to the branch personnel to be able to work. Obtained DTA privileges which help with our C2C4 capabilities to ship our software when needed.

- Planning:
  Met with the NUWC team who works on YEEHAWROCK as well as Chartlets team to discuss YEEHAWRT capabilities, resulting in progressive workflows for all teams. Each sprint for YEEHAWRT, outlined tasks and estimated time required for each to ensure tasks were done in a timely manner without blocking other developers in order to ease development of YEEHAWRT.

- Execution:
  Fulfilled short notice sponsor requirements change for YEEHAWRT and YEEHAWMAGIC by identifying and fixed several critical issues, and multiple interim deliveries were made during the week, leveraging development pipelines to effectively manage time constraint crisis to meet multiple YEEHAWRT deadlines.

- Customer Interaction Level:
  Collaborated with the sponsors to determine software requirements for FY22 by creating a drafted timeline and scoping tasks which leads to improved communication and controlled expectations.

- Customer Needs:
  Through sending release candidates of YEEHAWRT to the sponsors as well as demoing through the product to the sponsors and users was able to garner feedback and develop concretely, which increases the sponsors confidence.

LEADERSHIP:

- Scope of Leadership Influence:
  As a YEEHAWRT team member, provided guidance and insight on different technologies and tasking, which strengthens the future of development either by reducing code complexity or ease tasking of features.

- Leadership Activities:
  Mentored fellow NPs in addressing the Individual Development Plan (IDP) and navigating through NIWC Pacific. Able to conduct and research presentations to showcase different ways to develop for YEEHAWRT with pros, cons, ripples to consider, and investment.

- Mentoring/Employee Development:
  Received mentoring from seniors engineers within the organization. Finished Continuous Learning and pursued training with technologies becoming more adept across multiple projects.
