TECHNICAL:

- Scope/Impact:
  Designed and built software to produce an auto generating Basic Mission Report (BMR) for submarines known as the BMR Reconstruction Tool (YEEHAWRT). Integrating this software into submarine hardware known as YEEHAWROCK has enhanced the Navy's ability to maintain logistics of missions. Deployed YEEHAWRT to multiple submarines garnering positive feedback within the last year. Coordinated with the YEEHAWMAGIC team to complete parsers for 100+ clients.

  As a project lead, developed and deployed software solution for automatic generating documents, improving Navy's submarine mission logistics. Led team to successfully create parsers for over 100 clients. Demonstrated expertise in executing complex, multidimensional activities at a service/agency level.

- Complexity/Difficulty:
  With no prior knowledge of the software, implemented Redux, a software library that manages and centralizes an application's state, which will cut costs by reduce manual labor, reduce code duplication, and enable improved developer cycles on tasking. Implemented data science techniques on YEEHAWMAGIC while having no knowledge of technologies, quickly adapting to the task.

- Independence:
  Fully updated the team's development environments with latest and greatest patches, bug fixes, and quality of life updates to the software used to develop for YEEHAWRT which overall leads to implement updated features, reduce code complexity, and improve stability and speed of the application. Able to create full fledged parsers independently after min. guidance.

- Creativity:
  Implemented a software status indicator for YEEHAWRT to enable the user to identify if there are problems with connections to the software. This benefits users of YEEHAWRT by reducing risk of mistakes and ripple mistakes as well as improving communication within the submarine such as identifying where the proof of error is.

- Planning:
  Met with the NUWC team who works on YEEHAWROCK as well as Chartlets team to discuss YEEHAWRT capabilities, resulting in progressive workflows for all teams. Each sprint for YEEHAWRT, outlined tasks and estimated time required for each to ensure tasks were done in a timely manner without blocking other developers in order to ease development of YEEHAWRT.

- Execution:
  Fulfilled short notice sponsor requirements change for YEEHAWRT and YEEHAWMAGIC by identifying and fixed several critical issues, and multiple interim deliveries were made during the week, leveraging development pipelines to effectively manage time constraint crisis to meet multiple YEEHAWRT deadlines.

- Customer Interaction Level:
  Collaborated with the sponsors to determine software requirements for FY22 by creating a drafted timeline and scoping tasks which leads to improved communication and controlled expectations.
