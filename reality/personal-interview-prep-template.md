## About me

- ELEVATOR PITCH:
  - I'm a Computer Science Graduate from San Diego State University. My love of creating products combined with insight to coding concepts have led me to establish my goal of being a software developer.
  - I am a highly energetic and driven individual and use these attributes to motivate and inspire others. I pride myself as being a serving leader who places people before the task.
- RELEVANT EXPERIENCE:
- STRENGTHS:
  - Consistency of learning. There's always something out there to learn, pick apart, tinker with, and that's what drives me.
- WEAKNESSES:
  - I like getting into learning emerging technologies through documentation, tutorials, practice, but once I keep learning about it, the more I realize I don't know so much about it.
- WHY THIS ROLE/COMPANY:

## Questions to Prepare for (CAR Method! Context, Actions, Results!)

- How do you deal with failure?

  - I take a step back to reassess the situation without emotions, recognize the failure.
  - Am I feeling emotional?
  - Why do I feel emotional?
  - What can I do to prevent this in the future?
  - Slowly take my time building back up and reforming a new me, learning from mistakes, and building upon them.

- Handled a difficult situation?

  - My first hackathon I was completely new to coding and being put with a team that knew what they were doing so I asked myself "How can I be helpful?".
  - I asked them what I could work on within my scope, worked my strengths which was UI/UX design at the time, and made assets for the project we made.
  - The result is not only did I create UI/UX designs for our project, but I got to dive in deep into the code, asking my teammates about the intricacies of what does what and got to learn in the process.

- Stepped up as a leader?
  - At a LA hackathon, I realized that the team I was with had differences in level with the framework we were working on which was React. We had our seasoned developer focused on a specific problem while we had another developer experiencing issues with their problem.
  - Unsure of my skill, I went ahead and mentored the other developer to keep the seasoned developer focused on their high-level problem and did some pair programming.
  - This resulted in our project being completed faster through delegation of tasks and the severity of them as well.
