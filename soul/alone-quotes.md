" ur so quiet " thanks im not comfortable around u
"are u okay" can we change the topic before I give up
"Are you ok” no i have to wake up tomorrow
"are you okay" bro have you seen my Twitter account
"how are u" i'm literally going insane thank you for your concern
"hows life going" idk bro im trying not to think about it
"i am here for you" is ELITE when it comes from someone you needed most
"I can make time for you" - a love language
"i wanna see you" is on of the best texts, texting all day is boring.
"it gets better" bro its been gradually getting worse for years
"it's fine" = you really disappointed me but I'm used to it lol
"it's okay" I'm actually hurt but nah it's cool
"oh ok" actually means my heart just got ripped to pieces but I'm just gonna stay quiet
"r u okay" no, next question
"ur so chill" thanks i don't care about anything anymore
"ur so quiet" bro please dont make me talk
"ur so quiet" thanks my brain is broken and i have no thoughts
"who hurt you" me: I got a real bad habit of getting real quiet and distancing without explaining why
"who hurt you" what a dumb question
"who hurt you" bro who didn't
"YoU dOn'T tExT bAcK" ik leave me alone
"you reply fast" my bad ur the only one i talk to
"You're too young to be stressed about love. Chase your dreams, not people."
“are u ok?” no i literally hate being alive
“damn who hurt you” bitch everyone
“I only want you” is the energy I deserve
“No one knows what you feel inside.”
“u busy later?” yes im busy doing absolutely nothing leave me alone
“ur so chill” thanks i am completely disconnected from reality right now

4 stages when I fall for someone: 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 😕😕😕😕😕 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
666 followers I pray you all have a great day ily 🥺
7 million ppl on earth and u still single 😭😭😭
a date would be cool but nvm
a day without conversation with you is so damn sad
a day without overthinking, please
a feeling you just cant explain
A partner with the same vibe as yours &gt;&gt;
A person who is okay with being alone is a powerful person
a person with a "let's get through this shit together" mindset &gt;
A simple “my bad you’re right, I can see why you feel that way” could go a long way
a strong friendship doesn’t need daily conversations
a text saying "can we fix this, i can't lose u" &gt;&gt;
actions speak loud, words don't matter
Addressing where you BOTH went wrong instead of pinning everything on one person&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
after a breakup the loyal one stays single and deals with the damage until its healed, but the other one is already in another relationship. LET THAT SINK IN
after crying, i found love for myself
after someone hurts you, you're not the same anymore
after someone hurts you, you're not the same anymore
Alexa, turn my feelings off
All I wanna do is talk to you
alright so it all started when I was born
always trust your heart and gut , they neva lie
always trying to be enough for you
always will be sad as fuck
An apology without change is manipulation. Read that again
and now u look at them like : 😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕
and then they forget about you in the end 😂😂
and they don't even notice you😥
another day passed of me being sad what's new
another long night of overthinking... for what?
another night overthinking for no reason
another night overthinking when does it end.
anxiety has no bedtime
anxiety hitting me all day everyday especially at night
anxiety just said what the fuck is up I'm never leaving your side
anxiety really be hitting at night in waves
anxiety: everyday life: i will end it all
anyone else just go through everyday just to make it to another
anyone else just going through life like "yeah i just gotta get past this last difficult week &amp; then im good" but like... every week
anyone ever just make your heart feel warm?
anyone wanna come over and just be nice to me
apology without change is just manipulation
appreciate your loved ones and hold them close. you never know when it will be the last time.
are you gonna forget about me or be different
are you in love?
are you still on my mind? yes yes yesyes yesyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yesyes yes yes yes yesye yes yes yes yes yesyes
As bad as u wanna address it, some things are better left unsaid
As long as you trying to do better, better will come. Don’t worry bout a thing
asking again when does the pain end
Asking twice is too close to begging.
at my funeral don't cry. I've been dead inside for a long time and y'all didn't care
attitude, maturity and mindset are more attractive than looks.
awake but at what cost https://t.co/ruuOc0Ppgj
be careful how much you tolerate because you’re teaching them how to treat you
be forgiving. be understanding. but don’t be a fool.
be honest with me even if it hurts
be my permanent happiness
be patient with time and love will come your way💞
be patient, good things come with time
be straight up with me even if u think it'll hurt my feelings I rather know than overthink literally everything
be up front with how you feel and avoid a lot of pain
been alone, will be alone, forever alone.
been hurt &amp; forgotten about without them ever looking back and lost myself in the process
been hurting since 3rd grade and never went back
been trying to sleep but overthinking took over instead
Before I give up on anybody, I try &amp; I try &amp; I try...
before you do me dirty make sure u never need me again
being alone makes u realize so much.
being hurt by the same person you explained ur pain is heartbreaking fr.
being in love in the 50's was probably sum different
being in pain only shows you a new path to find happiness
being loyal ain’t hard people just immature
being loyal to someone even without a relationship🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
being sad is the hardest drug
being sad is the only consistency I'll ever have in my life
being single is nice until its 1 in the morning and ur tryna have a deep conversation bout life or whatever but you have nobody to talk to
Being up late ain't even fun no more this shit annoying
being used makes you wonder for a lot of years..
being wanted by the same person you want is a feeling that is unmatched
being weird together is a love language. Idc
best feeling ever is finally losing your attachment to somebody that wasn't good for you
best friends first, relationship later
Best thing i ever did was stop telling people what’s going on in my life
better days are coming
Better days are coming. You won’t always wake up in the morning with a heavy heart
Breakups are ok. Starting over is ok. Moving on is ok. Saying no is ok. Being alone is ok. What is not ok is staying somewhere where u are not happy, valued, or unappreciated, that's not ok.

but fuck that lol.
but i never needed to be anywhere anyways
but I'm gonna still keep trying tho😔
but one thing that hurts me the most is seeing the person I love the most slowly falling back as days pass and you can't do anything about it
but should it?
but they forgot about me
but you told me you wouldn't leave lol
call me, i miss u
can some romantic shit happen to me for fucks sake
can we normalize being quiet i don't always have something to say
Can we normalize ignoring people until you’re in a good mood.
can't wait to cry tonight
can’t wait for the day when somebody tells me I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to them and they mean it
Cheating = End of relationship, No Discussion.
CHEATING IS A CHOICE NOT A MISTAKE
congrats to those who moved on without getting an apology
congratulations to those who found partners with true intentions. that shit is rare. i congratulate you.
Consistency is a love language
Crazy part about being a overthinker is most times you right
Crazy part about being a overthinker is most times you right
crushes are called crushes because that person crushes ur fuckin soul man
current mood: i wanna see you
cut them off respectfully, don't even do the most.
damn i miss that feeling of being happy
damn, i miss the old days.
damn, i wish i'm enough
date someone who staaaays OBSESSED with u, not just in the beginning
Dating to marry. That’s it.
deadass FUCK having feelings
dear bed, you’re my true love
dear heart, sorry for all the pain
dear self, stop overthinking
dear self: sorry for this unhealthy sleeping routine
deleting the whole text and saying "ok" will save you from a lot.
demons living inside of my thoughts
depend on yourself for happiness and it will come to you
depression is embarrassing bc sometimes it makes you lost in time &amp; not return phone calls &amp; when the fog starts to lift you gotta do a whole fuckin apology tour
despite the aftermath between us, wish you the best
detachment from toxicity heals your soul
different levels of anxiety is something that no one should have to go through
different type of hurt
Disagreements are fine. Disrespect is not. Distance is fine. Disloyalty is not
Distance yourself emotionally for a while, you'll learn a lot.
distraction from reality can only be so good while it lasts
Do me a favor, don't do me any favors.
do u ever look at a text and just think fuck you
do u ever look back at a really good point in ur life and wish you'd cherished it more
do u ever try to be okay with something but the more and more you think about it it just makes u sick to your stomach?
do what's best for you
do what's right for your happiness
do y'all think you are someone's favorite person? honest question
Do you believe in love at first sight?
do you ever get sad and forget to eat for 31 hours and just be like oh fuck lol
do you ever hear someone breathe and think shut the fuck up.
do you ever lay in bed and get sad because ur favorite person isn’t with you
do you ever lay in bed and realize how alone you are?
do you miss your ex?
do yourself a favor and take mixed signals as a no
do. not. put. effort. into. people. who. don’t. give. it. back
Does it bother me? yes. Will I ever tell you? no.
does someone's name ever give u PTSD or are u normal?😭😭
don't apologize to me if u can't change what you're sorry for
don't ask me about relationship advice. I'm single-handedly ruining my whole fucking life
don't be sad, no one care
don't ever give up
Don't force friendships. They either like you or they don't
don't get too comfortable, they never stay
don't give up someone will change your life someday
don't hurt yourself trying to repair someone else
don't leave me okay? i love you
don't let anything get to you, notice, speak on it and learn from it
don't make her feel stupid for loving you
don't mistreat my heart I will break yours
don't obsess over anyone it's too much, let love come to you.
don't stress about shit you can't change. have a day that is good for once.
don't tempt me lol
don't text me you miss me when you had all my attention &amp; took it for granted
don't waste ur time on someone who leaves you questioning them‼
don’t get too comfortable, they never stay.
don’t message first and see how many dead plants you been watering
don’t stress what you can’t control
dont ask me what i think because i dont
Dont get too comfortable that's when the bullshit happens.
drained of all my energy
drunk n sad
dry texting is the most annoying thing don't hit me up at all
due to personal reasons I wont be giving a fuck....ever again
due to personal reasons I wont be giving a fuck....ever again.
effort is attractive as fuck, fuck all the other shit
efforts are better than promises
even the people closest to you forget about you and that shit hurts the most
ever felt homesick over a person?
ever have a breakdown for what feels like no reason but your body just shuts down?
ever just wanted someone consistent
ever meet someone and when without them you felt homesick?
ever wonder how different your life would be if that one person didn't ruin you
every day i think about you, while you think about someone else
Everybody says they are fine, but only few are actually happy
everyone is temporary as fuck
everything happens for a reason i get it but like wtf
everything i love i keep private now
everything is good for .3 seconds until it's back to falling apart 24/7
everything is just fine until it isn't again for the 18,375th time
everytime i wake up i be like what the fuck
expectations will ruin you, don't have any.
eye contact is such a precious form of intimacy
Fake people got an image to maintain. Real people just don’t care lol
fall in love with someone who will never stop choosing you
fast replies r fire
feeling so much but nothing all at once
feeling useless &amp; unwanted.
feels so alone but never lonely
find someone who knows how to love you when ur sad
find someone who knows how to love you when you’re sad
first it hurts, then it changes you
first it hurts, then it changes you
for my next trick i will disappear forever
for real you just switched up that quick huh
for the sake of your mental health, always take mixed signals as a no
forcing yourself not to talk to somebody because they no longer deserve u is the hardest thing ever
forever alone
Forgiveness does not require reconnection.
from "come over" to "come home" is a real relationship goal for me
fuck a thought I'm done thinking
fuck all these relationship goals just get someone you can vibe with and be yourself around without having to stress about shit
fuck bein sad everynight
fuck small talk how old were you when it all went wrong
getting broken by someone while trying to figure them out is the purest form of heartbreak
getting fucked over damages you differently than even imaginable
getting no message is also a message
give it a second and watch that good day be gone fast, be thankful.
give someone ur all n they forget about u
glad i realized to never depend on anyone and don’t expect anything from ANYBODY
go to sleep no one cares that you're sad
Goin thru shit alone really do build you
going through shit alone really teaches you a lot.
going to sleep with a mind full of unsaid thoughts just dont sit right with me
good morning i guess https://t.co/TKNOAIfkM0
goodmorning to everyone except cheaters
goodnight but nothing about it is good
goodnight https://t.co/pFC2A0nbjC
goodnight i love you say it back🥺
gotta be careful who you put first you might be last to them
gotta fucking love it
greatest comeback? is being yourself again and making yourself happy
guess I never mattered
hahahah, i’m kidding... ᵘⁿˡᵉˢˢ ʸᵒᵘ’ʳᵉ ᵈᵒʷⁿ
half the shit u stressing about ain't worth it fr
hard to sleep when ur sad n alone
have no expectations, or you'll end up fucking yourself over
Have you ever gotten in a fight with someone bc u told them what was bothering you and instead of them apologizing they find a way to make you feel bad about it so ur left regretting even saying anything.
have you ever just got sad because you're you
have you ever lost all respect for someone? like you don't hate them but you don't feel the need to associate yourself or say anything to them anymore
have you ever sat back questioned your existence and just got sad lol
Have you thanked yourself for carrying you this far in life yet?
HAVE?? U?? EVER?? TEXTED?? SOMEONE?? AND?? THEIR?? ENERGY?? MAKES?? U?? REGRET?? THE?? WHOLE?? CONVERSATION??
haven't been able to think straight ever since
having late night thoughts about that one person will run your thoughts insane
having me is so boring, sorry
having real friends that have your back and you can just chill, talk &amp; catch up where it just flows.
having someone u can tell every detail of ur day to without feeling like ur being clingy is such a great feeling
having to walk away from a relationship you really wanted to work out messes you up
heal so when someone shows you love, you believe them
healing is so weird. one day you're fine, one day ur not.
healing is so weird. one second you're fine, a second later u give up completely
Hear me out... Imagine having the power to unmeet someone 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
heartbreak changes you
heartless as fuck who this
Heavy on "get home safe" bc anything could happen.
here i am alone
hey fuck your late replies just don't reply
hey overthinkers, we are gonna be okay
hey, you matter. one day someone will prove it to you just chill alone and have some self love.
hi quick question when does the pain end
hi, I'm trying to be ok
high off life even though im constantly overthinking
honestly im better on my own
hope ur thinking of me
hope you remember me
hopefully one day it will all make sense
how am i stressing and not giving a shit at the same time
how can i be so happy yet so sad and empty at the same time wtf is this
how did everything fall off so quickly?
how do we skip the sad days
how it be https://t.co/2g4rEoAbBs
how lucky do two people have to be in order to fall for each other at exactly the right time in exactly the right way
how old were you when depression hit?
how old were you when u were traumatized
How rich would you be if you made $1 for everytime you overthink
how someone reacts to ur sadness shows how long they are going to be in your life
how the hell can one person be so fucking attractive???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????¿
how u miss something u ended
https://t.co/W2DBUgMT16
i accepted it already, but it still makes me overthink
i accepted it already, but it still makes me sad
i actually enjoy being alone don't get me wrong i like company but shit i rather my own
I ain't even mad because you did what I expected you to
i ain't forcing nothing, i learned my lesson...
i ain’t forcing nothing, i learned my lesson...
i am not a morning person or a night person actually infact i don't even know if im a person
i appreciate people checking up on me
i appreciate those who ask if i’m okay
i automatically go silent when i hear something that hurts me
I automatically go silent when I hear something that triggers my paranoia
i automatically stop trying when i feel unwanted
i automatically stop trying when i feel unwanted
I barely got friends but I got the real ones &gt;&gt;&gt;
I be accidentally going MIA on people. I swear it's nothing personal. I just like being alone😂
i be heavy on the “mmhmm” cause PEOPLE just lie soooo much 😂
i be like "I'm so lonely" then don't respond to anyone
i be like "yeah its fine" then suffer in silence
i be like "yeah its fine" then suffer in silence
i be like “i’m so tired” when in reality i’m Just sad
I be so fucking depressed man
i be so in love with the fake scenarios i create in my head.
i be so in luv with the fake scenarios i create in my head
I been removing myself out of people's lives alot lately, they don't deserve me
I been sad for a long time but fuck it we lit
i been stuck in that weird mood where nothings really wrong but nothing feels right either
I break my own heart expecting people to be as attached to me as I am to them lol
i broke my own heart trying to be enough
i broke my own heart tryna be enough for someone
i broke my rules for you and that's some shit i'm never gonna do again smh
i can be sorta toxic but i don't cheat
i can ignore you the same way you ignore me just you won't hear from me again
i can't force you to appreciate me but u sure gonna feel it when i'm gone
i cant believe i used to go crazy for u 😂 how embarrassing
i care so so much until I don't lol
I care until I don’t and once Idc... Idgaf
I cried for u, u said fuck that. now I'm heartless.
i deserve someone who actually gives a fuck about me bc I've spent my entire life making other people happy when all they did was leave.
I deserve someone who really wanna be with me .
i do what i do for people because i wish i had a person like me in my life
I don't even know what's going on half the time
I don't know who needs to hear this but one day everything you were ever looking for will find you, keep pushing.
i don't know who needs to hear this but, don't give up, okay? keep going.
i don't think people understand how observant i am, like im really not a fool
i don't want hoes.. i want ur dumbass
i don’t like being without u
I dont even understand my own feelings.
i dont know if you needed to see this but leave them alone if they don't make the effort to see you
I dont want to get hurt, again.
i feel like ghosting everyone and calling it a year
i feel like i really don't belong anywhere
I feel my body giving up
i feel so dumb after expressing any emotion
i find it attractive when someone is straight forward with their intentions so you don’t have to wonder if they fwu like that or not
i forgot how to be happy
i found someone i never want to lose
i found u, that's enough.
I gave up.... on giving up. Fuck that shit
I get in moods where i just deadass hate being talked to
I give mental health advice like I ain't going crazy every 2 minutes
I got anxiety ft. anxiety
I got u until you got me fucked up
I hate feeling like I'm bothering the only mf I wanna talk to
I hate giving up on people but I hate forcing shit even more
i hate how sadder i get everyday
I hate it when memories hit me.
I hate that I distance when I'm sad
i HATE that i require so much reassurance like things could be going perfectly fine but there's always a part of me that believes all of it is a lie
I hate when I go out in public and the public be there
I have never felt so useless
I have trust issues but still end up trusting the wrong people.... HOW
I hope someone loves you someday but until then love yourself, you deserve it.
I hope we never lose each other
i hope you heal from the trauma that no one ever apologized for
i ignored everyone for you
I isolate myself when I'm going thru shit
i just don't give my energy out to be drained ever again.
i just feel so empty sometimes
i just let anything be nowadays.
i just wanna be happy. not confused, not hurt, not stressed, just happy.
I just wanna feel important to someone
I just wanna fuck with someone that ain’t fucking with nobody else or being sneaky

i just want a day without overthinking
i just wanted you but nvm
I keep a lot to myself because it's hard to find people who understand
I knew I matured when I was okay with nobody knowing my side of the story
I know I'm changing because I be calm about shit the old me would've lost it for.
i know ur happiness, it's not me
i like people you can have comfortable silences with
i lost my smile again but I'm okay
I love a “talk to me, what’s wrong” person
I love all 55,555 of you💗 thank you
I love being alone, I hate feeling alone...it's different

I miss that feeling I used to get of excitement

i miss you. but its okay, i'm fine
i need a long deep hug from you
i need someone who needs me and doesn't let go
I need you the most right now
i never faked my "i miss you" to someone
I ONLY WANT ONE PERSON I ONLY CRAVE ONE PERSON I ONLY LOVE ONE PERSON I ONLY NEED ONE PERSON
i overlived at this point
i overthink a lot, and end up hurting my own feelings
i overthink about fucking everything and there's nothing i can do about it
i overthink because i don't trust shit anymore
i overthink because i notice everything
i overthink cuz im always fucking right
i overthink. i overlove. i overfeel
I owe myself an apology for all the shit i let slide
I peep shit &amp; start dry texting like a mf😂
i pray my friends get through the battles that they don't tell me about
i pray to God i never lose you
i pray you heal from things no one ever apologized for
I probably wouldn't be alive without you
i promise you "right person wrong time" is a real thing
I rather be alone than feel alone next to someone I love
I rather sleep next to you
I really do deserve the best.
i really don’t care about anything anymore lmao
I really hate how observant I am, I will literally break my own heart
i really miss making you smile but it is what it is
i remember being happy
I remember when someone used to care enough to be consistent lol
i said it once I'll say it again: if. someone. truly. cares. you. wouldn't. have. to. question. them.
I should've hugged you tighter the last time I saw you
i stay solid even on bad terms, thats the part mfs dont understand about loyalty
I still care about you, I’m just tired of trying
i still care i'm just done showing it
I tell everybody I'm good cuz what u gone do if I'm not
i tell everybody i’m fine cause what they gonna do if i’m not
i tested positive for co.....nstantly wanting to end it all
i think like this every night..
I thought I was special, until I saw u treating others the same way.
i used to be shy now i just don't wanna talk to anyone
I used to feel left out so I make sure you know your worth
I wanna be a better person. A better friend. A better lover. A better me. Just better.
i wanna be happy to the point i forget everything i been through
I wanna be the one who makes your bad days better
i wanna build a relationship with someone who cares about "why" I've been quiet all day. not someone who gets mad because I'm "acting different"
I wanna fall in love &amp; nvr break up
I wanna fall in love &amp; nvr break up
i wanna go out but when i go out i wanna go be alone
I wanna mute my mind and my feelings
i wanna mute my overthinking
ⁱ ʷᵃⁿⁿᵃ ˢᵉᵉ ᵘ ᵃⁿᵈ ʰᵘᵍ ᵘ ˢᵒ ᵗⁱᵍʰᵗ
i wanna skip these heavy days
i wanna skip these heavy nights
I want my first marriage to be my only.
i want someone who only wants me
i want the same energy i give out for a change
i want to cry but i have shit to do
I want to sleep for one year
I want you, not them
I want your attention but I won't ask for it
i wanted you at your worst and you didn't give a fuck
I was a victim to shit I wouldn't have done to others.
I was hurting alone.. that shit made me different
I went through my darkest times alone so I'm sorry if I act like I dont need anyone
I will never forget what’s said to me outta anger
i wish i could be a kid again with no worries or expectations, life really hitting hard but we gone get through it.
i wish i could get a refund on all the love I've wasted on people.
i wish i could unmeet some people
i wish i didn't exist
i wish i had a playlist of all the songs i used to love but forgot about
I wish my thoughts would relax sometimes. Like damn nothing is even wrong right now.
i wish we had the same feelings
i won't wait forever
I wonder how many times we forgive someone just because we don't wanna lose them..
I wonder if anyone will ever want me
i would like to stop remembering
I would not complain about anything if I didn't have anxiety
i wouldn't give up life lessons learned to go back in time and change it all, just miss those pure moments that I'll never get back.
I'll always be there for you if you really need me
I'll always have love for you.
I'll always love you
I'll be ok... I just don't know when
I'll choose you everytime
I'll hit u with that "it's cool nvm" so quick
I'll just be right here, overthinking
i'll let shit eat me up before i speak on my pain to anybody
I'll make you happy even if it will break me
I'll never be wanted as much as I want
I'll never forget the day you forgot about me
I'll never stop caring about you
I'll stay quiet as much as I can
I'M TIRED OF ACTING LIKE EVERYTHING IS okay
I'm an overthinker so if you don't give me an answer, I'll come up with one
i'm asking will life ever be painless?
I'm constantly torn between "if it's meant to be, it will be" and "if you want it, go and get it"
I'm done begging for your attention
i'm done trying IoI
I'm fine I got me... don't worry
I'm happy I only gotta do this being alive shit one time
I'm here if you need me, always
i'm hurt but i'm always silent
i'm just gonna "no❤" my way thru life
I'm just tired
i'm not anyone's first choice. i'm not anyone's favorite. people may tell me I mean a lot to them but I know there's someone they will choose over me.
I'm not arguing anymore. I'm sending "ok" and going on about my life...
I'm not mad. I'm hurt. There's a difference
i'm not okay, but that's part of life. it will be okay.
I'm not rebuilding a bond I didn't break. Fuck u
i'm okay but i'm not. i'm not happy. i'm not sad. most of the time. i don't even know i feel confused. i guess i'm living but i'm not.
I'm scared to tell people how much it hurts, so I keep it all to myself
i'm slowly becoming the person I should've been a long time ago.
I'm slowly losing interest at everything
I'm so sorry if someone made you think it's hard to love you
i'm so sorry if someone made you think it's hard to love you
I'm so tired of everything
I'm sorry if I ever hurt you
i'm sorry, i can't unlove you
I'm still full of love, just more cautious
I'm such a "nah I got it" and suffer in silence kinda person
I'm that person who sticks around longer than I should. But once I'm gone, I'm gone
i'm tired, but i'm still trying my best.
I'm trapped between "i want to talk to you" and "i dont feel like bothering you"
I'm tryna be with your cute ass foooorrrrrrrreeeevvvvvvvveerrrrrrr
i'm waiting for a text to change my bad mood
I've given so much just be left alone not wanting to wake up
I've noticed the best way to get someone's attention is to not want it anymore.
I’ll block you on everything &amp; never talk to you again, I’m really like that
I’m damaged too.. but I’ll never hurt anyone the same way I’ve been hurt
i’m not saying to text me 24/7 but at least lmk what ur doing so i don’t trip
I’m not toxic I just expect to be treated as a priority and not an option
I’m such a “but I feel bad” type of person
i😡😡😡wanna😡😡😡😡cuddle😡😡😡😡until😡😡😡😡😡all😡😡😡😡my😡😡😡😡😡sadness😡😡😡😡is😡😡😡😡gone😡😡
i😡😡😡wanna😡😡spend😡😡😡the😡😡rest😡😡😡of😡😡my😡😡😡life😡😡😡with😡😡you😡😡😡
idc
idc who i lose anymore, as long as i don't lose myself again, i'm good.
idk who needs to hear this but sometimes you have to go through heartbreak to find love for yourself you just have to keep pushing
idk who needs to hear this, but stop depending on others for your happiness
If I don't got me, nobody got me
If I dont annoy you, I dont like you
if I even get married
if i ever cared about you I'll have your back still even after you forgot about me
if i ever opened up to you forget it happened
if I ever opened up to you I was joking
If i gained nothing by dealing with you what can i lose by leaving you alone lol
If I get distant I learned my place with you
if i got paid $10 for every hour i spend being depressed i would be living large
if i hurt you, im sorry
if i really fw you, i’d give you the whole world even when mines falling apart and you'd still expect more
if i sleep early it means im sad
if i sleep for a month will it fix me
if I tell you about my past, it means I trust you
if i want you, i promise no one else is getting the same attention
If I'm into u, no one else is getting the same attention
if i'm telling you how i feel and you make it seem like we arguing, i'm not telling you how i feel ever again
If it ain’t all mine, keep it
if it's with you im down
If it’s mine, it’ll come back to me.
If nobody got me, I got me
if someone is okay with losing you they never really cared for you
if they wanted to they would
if two people look happy together, leave them alone
if u break someone and they still wish the best for u, you've lost the greatest thing for u.
if u cheat u ain't in love .. you just in love with the thought of having someone solid by your side.
if u cheat ur not in love idc
if u cheat ur ugly idc
If u ever feel I’m getting distant I learned my place with u
if u love someone tell them before u can't
if u want me, act like it
if ur in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable, it won't happen overnight but leave that shit
if we date u gotta ignore my twitter
if we don't talk again, i'm sorry for ur loss
if y’all see me catching feelings again, throw a brick at my head please.
if you are not able to give your full to someone go focus on your mental health and love yourself
if you are reading this you matter never let anyone tell you that you aren't shit because you can do it better than they ever fucking could
if you ignore me now you're choosing to ignore me later too
if you lost someone but found yourself, you won.
if you love something you might have to let it go
if you miss me you can call me
if you need to heal, dissapear for a little bit you might need it more than you think
if you really like someone you will forget about anyone else
if you see me happy please leave me alone......i really deserve this shit
If you still around I love you.
if you treat me right, i got your back.
if you unsure about me leave me alone
if your heart ever tells you that something doesn't feel right, don't ignore it
ignore me all you want I'll talk to myself i'm insane
ignoring red flags because you wanna see the good in people will cost you later
ik ima get thru it, just tired of goin thru it
ily
Im a “nvm” ass person. I get irritated fast “nvm don’t worry about it"
im afraid of getting hurt again
Im back from my never ending depression episode
im chill on the outside but on the inside im dying
im currently not fighting depression im actually cool with it
im damaged as heII but I’ll never hurt anyone the way I’ve been hurt
im damaged as hell but I’ll never hurt anyone the way I’ve been hurt
im like stressing but not giving af at the same time
im not depressed i just havent felt happiness since i was 11
im not depressed i just havent felt happiness since i was 12
Imagine
imagine being able to interact with someone without feeling annoying
imagine being loved the way you love.
imagine being loved the way you love.
imagine being wanted back by the only person you want
imagine choosing someone who chooses u
Imagine dating me and then boom we just last forever &amp; we're both happy asf. Wild.
Imagine falling in love and it works out for the rest of your life
imagine getting hurt by the person who wanted you first 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
imagine happiness
imagine holding a grudge on someone but not taking your actions into accountability. some people never learn 🤷‍♂️
imagine if your crush like you back😳
imagine someone imagining you
imagine someone saying "can we fix this, I can't lose you"
in a genuine way not where you obsess over them, just appreciating their presence more than life itself.
in another life, i wish i'm happy.
in the mood to just disappear forever
isn't it crazy how one day u randomly meet someone then months later down the line looking back they've became a big part of your life &amp; u can no longer imagine your life without them in it? like yeah they're prolly gonna leave but for now yeah lol
It be the ones you'll do anything for that treat u like nobody.
it hurts everyday when I open my eyes
it hurts so bad but it's only temporary. you will get through it
it hurts the most when the person that made you feel so special yesterday, makes you feel so unwanted today
it hurts, but I'm getting used to it
it scares me how temporary everything is
it still hurts. not often. but still
It sucks being a SUPERRRR observant person bc i notice every little thing &amp; i literally get annoyed over the smallest things
It will always be that way
it will be okay give it time🥺
it will get better
it's a late night feels kinda night
it's attractive when someone stays up late just to talk to you
it's cool do your thing i be chilling
it's fine I'm just gonna focus on me no worries
it's hard to trust when all you have from the past is evidence why u shouldn't.
it's heartbreaking when you give someone the world but they still choose to look for something better
it's not worth feeling like you aren't enough, fuck that.
It's ok to disappear for a while until you feel like you again
It's ok to disappear until you feel like u again.
it's ok to forgive people and still cut them off
It's ok. I mean it's not ok but its ok.
it's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay its okay
it's okay not to be okay but one day you will be okay
it's okay to be sad sometimes
it's okay to disappear to heal or grow
it's okay, I mean sometimes it's not okay but fuck will it ever fully be okay?
it's okay, tomorrow is better
it's the person you never saw coming that'll change your life.
it’s attractive when someone stays up late just to talk to you
It’s difficult to explain so I stay quiet
It’s like there’s no light at the end of this tunnel
it’s the person you never saw coming that’ll change your life
Its "never again" for a lot of things
its attractive when you get the same effort you give
jk i dont feel shit anymore
Just cause I address it doesn’t mean I’m tryna argue. I’m communicating
just don't waste my time
just feeling confused
just incase they're playing with your heart though... do this. https://t.co/xwJXI3Mc5u
just keep trying
just kidding i don't expect shit anymore
just say sheeeesh and move on
just say yikes and move on
just tell me how you're feeling and I'll make it into a tweet🙌
just waiting for anxiety to give me a day off
just wanna sleep and feel nothing
just want something that lasts
just want to give the world to you but you make that shit so fucking hard lmao
keep going, don't question yourself, work for better, be better, for you and you will get through it.
keep going, sometimes you might hurt yourself but learn from that lesson and make sure to not hurt someone in return
keep smiling through the pain
keep trying, keep going no matter what they say and do it that much better
keep your whole life lowkey and let people assume incorrectly
kinda sad tonight but that's okay
kinda tired of being okay with things I'm not okay with
know ur worth
late night thoughts been fuckin me up lately
late night thoughts keep me awake everynight
lately I’ve been trying to find peace with my loneliness but some nights it just consumes me
learn from your mistakes, keep moving
leave me alone for the rest of my life fr
leave me alone forever
left alone with no outlet shit really hurts different
let go and forget about everything sometimes
let growth manifest
Let love find you
Let them miss you
let's be together forever
Letting people get your hopes up then your left sad and disappointed
life goes by fast show your care for someone fully or not at all and don't waste your time &amp; someone else's.
life goes on
life is depressing and then you die
life is getting harder and more impossible by the day, just know there is a light at the end of the path keep pushing.
life is like time traveling and sometimes you get frozen in your tracks
life moves way too fast, make sure you take care of your mental health daily 🥰
Life taught me anybody can switch up, no matter how much history you have.
like FUCK
lmao i give up
LMAOOOOO gn
Lol
lol fuck that
lol fuck that
lonely hours
losing a bond with someone u really fuck with really hurts
losing someone special changes you
losing something special changes you alot
losing toxic people is a win
losing toxic people is a win.
losing yourself in the process
lost myself trying not to lose someone else
lost myself trying to find someone else
love is the most powerful drug
love me at my worst
love yourself and know that every roadblock will only motivate you to go harder
love yourself first, then you'll never feel alone again
make time to love yourself because at the end of the day that's all you have 💔
making yourself happy will make others around you happy
maturity is attractive as fuck
maturity is so attractive...
maybe I deserve all this pain
maybe i deserve better but i want you
maybe i just expect too much
maybe I'll try again tomorrow..
maybe I'll wake up happy tomorrow
maybe if i fall in love with my depression itll leave me too
maybe in another lifetime lol
maybe one day, it can be me and you.
me for no reason https://t.co/YinLeg4IeD
me thinking someone actually wants me back 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

Mental health conversations are so important in relationships
mental health is important focus on yourself 💗
Mental health is real. Depression is real. Suicide is real. Always check up on the people you love.
mf nowadays expect you to wait forever for them to change
Mfs say “I’m good” then cut everyone off for months, I’m mfs
might fuck around and pretend to be happy loll
missing someone at night hits different
missing someone who forgot about u is really painful
missing you
missing you but I probably shouldn't
missing you like you were mine to even miss lol
mood always https://t.co/FSF0eewBTw

mood: wanting attention but only from one specific person
more like that's why i dont talk to anyone anymore 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
move on. do better for yourself before wasting your time on someone who doesn't care about yours.
moving on and cutting out toxicity is key to mental health and your path to what is best for you
murderer: any last words? me: thanks murderer: damn, u good?
my anxiety makes me think everyone secretly dislikes me
my anxiety makes me think everyone secretly dislikes me
my bed knows all my pain
My biggest turn off is inconsistency, acting like u care one day and then switch up the next. That's how u lose me.
my brain hurts from the pain
my coping mechanisms are probably worse than my actual problems lol
my daily routine is very simple. i wake up and i suffer
my day be so fine then BOOM i start overthinking
my dumbass thinking imaginary scenarios before a relationship even starts
my favorite forms of love is being loved without feeling like i’m asking for it
my happiness ain't ever lasted more than 2 hours
my heart feels weak but I'm gonna keep grinding
ᵐʸ ʰᵉᵃʳᵗ ᶠᵘᶜᵏⁱⁿᵍ ʰᵘʳᵗˢ
my heart wants u, only u
my heart wants you, only you
my intentions are always pure unfortunately
my last relationship taught me that i never want to feel like i’m begging for someone’s love, ever
my life is a prank
my mind so toxic i be happy asf until i sit back &amp; start thinking
my mom said "stop being the 'go to' person for someone you can't go to" and i FELT THAT
My mom taught me if they didn't invite you.... don't ask to go
My mood just goes 📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📈📈📉📈📉📈📈📈 all day
My only talent : 💕💘💘💖💖💖💘💘💕💕 💕💖overthinking💕💕 💕💖💕💖💕💖💕💖💕💖
my overthinking ability feels like I'm in jail
my parents still havent apologized to me for making me ugly
my soul aches
My tolerance for people is gone.
my toxic trait is being productive for 2 minutes and then giving my self a 2 hour break
My toxic trait is feeling unwanted and removing myself first so I don’t feel rejected
My toxic trait is getting in my moods and not wanting to speak to anyone
my toxic trait is I know how to love but I don’t know how to believe I’m loved
my toxic trait is I know how to love but I dont know how to believe I'm loved
my trust aII fucked up, but I still try
my world is a better place because of you
nah I didn't "change". I just realized shit
naturally introverted, selectively extroverted
need some fucking sleep but all i am is tired of being depressed
need some love smh
never been so tired in my life
never chase anyone the right person will walk with u
never disrespect someone that made sure you were okay when nobody else did
Never disrespect the girl that made sure you was good when nobody else did.
never expect energy to be reciprocated it will leave you broken
never felt so empty inside
never force anybody to appreciate you
never forget who was with you when you had nothing
never found love only regret and a new lesson
never get too attached to anyone unless they feel the same towards you, because one sided expectations will keep you up at night
never let a mf make u crazy. move on.
never mock a pain you haven't experienced
never run back to what broke u
never settle for less than u deserve
never trip about a text back, people make time for who they want
never trust anyone but yourself, until you can trust someone enough to give them your all
never wanna feel that pain again
Nevermind https://t.co/MkN5wRB8Tr
no friendship or relationship should be draining you
no matter how sad i get i always got u
no matter what happens just know I'll always be here for you
no one cares about you until the situation is beneficial to them
no response is a response
no words but thousands feelings
no, fuck you. i was good enough. but you made me believe i wasn't.
nobody cares how u feel, just smile
nobody gets on your nerves more than the mf you in love with
nobody too busy, u just ain’t a priority anymore
normalize disappearing without an explanation
not even feeling like myself anymore at this point
not even gon lie shit hurted
not everything is worth explaining
not everything lasts forever but you will get through it.
not gonna lie you got me feeling different
not heartless just using my heart less
not like i asked to be born anyways
not to flex but... I dont cheat.
not to flex, but i don’t cheat
nothing else matters tbh
nothing you can do about it 😥
now we are just a memory
Of course i'm picky. i know my worth
oh just like that?
oh wow been alone for a while now
once u find your person there's nobody else you want
once you heal it’s a wrap
one day
one day everything will fall into place just keep doing the best you can because you deserve to be happy like everyone else
one day maybe itll be right for us
one day soon when the time is right💔
one day u will meet someone who will understand ur story and protect u because they won't want u to suffer the same pain again
one day, you’ll be living the life you once prayed for
One day... I'm gonna have everything I prayed for. I really believe it.
one mistake ruined everything
one of the most toxic things I've done is ignore the bad in someone because i wanted to keep them in my life. never again.
One of the worst feelings is not knowing if you should just wait or just give up
one person can be everything
one person can change ur life
one person is enough 4 me. i b obsessed
only damaged people are awake rn
only the people who care about you can hear you when you're quiet
only unappreciated people are up rn
only unappreciated ppl are awake rn
out of sight but still on ur mind
overdosed by overthinking
overthinking at night is my special talent
Overthinking happens about 13 times a day for no reason
overthinking hits so hard late at night
overthinking is a drug with no cure
overthinking is reaIIy tiring
overthinking is the worst at night
overthinking kills your ability to be happy
overthinking should be a paid full time job
overthinking tonight what's new
Pain is just a lesson once you heal
pain is temporary but the person who hurt you is permanently never going to change, move on
Pay attention to WHEN &amp; WHY they hit you up
people are temporary, sadness is forever.
people be lying, knowing they lying, knowing you know they lying... and still lie
people get too comfortable with your presence and forget it's a priviledge
people just forget about you once they have you, don't waste your time trying to make someone stay.
people leave, learn to be okay with that.
people preach yet can't keep up to their word truly sad 😴
people see you have fun one time and think you faked depression
people that don't cheat wyd right now 👀
please be straight up with me even if u think it'll hurt my feelings I rather know than overthink literally everything
please don't fake your feelings
plot twist: you let someone in and they don't fuck you over
Probably should accept the fact that if they wanted you, they would prove it.
put me out my misery
Put. Yourself. First.
putting broken piece back together one by one
Quality of friends &gt; Quantity of friends
Random reassurance &gt;&gt; https://t.co/gyo8itbTgU
random waves of feeling like a waste of fucking air to breathe
ready for depression to stop kicking me in the fucking ass
really gotta just let go
reassurance without having to ask &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
relationships are so risky because no matter how good you are, they could just lose feelings for you just like that.
remove toxic people in your life, just chill
REPEAT AFTER ME: I am allowed to do what’s BEST for me even if it upsets other people
Reset. Restart. Refocus. As many times as you need to
respect the fact that I gave you my all when your forgot about me &amp; left me in the dark
Right person wrong time is real.... we'll meet again
risk is always better than regret
rock bottom is actually pretty nice. i am going to stay here
Rule #1: Always be prepared for anybody to switch up on you..
s o m e o n e i s s a d a g a i n
sad as fuck tonight
sad world we live in
sadness doesn't sleep and neither do i
sadness hits in waves at the most random times and there is nothing you can do about it
save some love for yourself, not everyone has the same heart as you
say "i love you" to ur second @ cuz why not
Saying ohhhhhhh when you just don’t care anymore &gt;&gt;&gt;
shit ends up hurting me more in the end anyways
shit hurts but you'll get through it
shit hurts different at night
shit never changes
shit will make sense in the end when you overcome adversity and thoughts u never saw leaving ur mind, does
show love to those close to you before they forget about you
sick and fucking tired of being alive
silence is the best answer to someone who doesn't value your words
simply give up and move on
sky is blue heart is broken fuck you, i have awoken
sleep cures all my problems until i wake up
sleep is rare, late night thoughts are forever
sleeping alone sucks
Sleeping is nice, until you wake up and realize ur still sad
smile no one will care for ur sadness
smile, like nothing happened
so many drafts filled with unsaid thoughts that might be too sad for the timeline
so many sad eyes on happy faces
so many things I could tweet but then I'd look too sad so I just chill
so many unsaid thoughts
So much pain.
so much sadness inside of me
so rare to find someone who sticks around these days😥
so refreshing when someone isn't just like everyone else lol
so sad but one day it will all be okay
Social media has ruined everything..... standards..... mindsets...... goals....... society.
some of yall need to realize YOU'RE the blessing, not them. they're so lucky to have YOU
Somebody is mad at you right now because you picked peace over drama and distance over disrespect.
someday you will meet the best version of you and it will have all been worth it
someday...😂 maybe
someone make my day please
someone wanna fall in love for a lil bit
someone who hurt me: me: yes I'm here for you
someone who wants u, will make u feel wanted
someone will appreciate my ugly ass one day
someone will love you
someone will love you just learn to love yourself and surround yourself with people who keep it consistent
someone WILL love you ONE day.
someone's effort is a reflection of their interest in u, remember that
sometimes a person means so much that you forget about everyone else
sometimes all you need is a goodnight text to fall asleep to
sometimes being sad hurts but is okay because you learn what allow into your life anymore
sometimes i be mad at myself for the heart i have
sometimes i feel what i ask for is too much
sometimes I just get anxiety out of nowhere with no reason like 19 times a day
sometimes I need space for a few days sometimes months and other times just forget i exist
sometimes it is better to be quiet
sometimes it's better to dissapear and come back better than before
Sometimes it’s better to just keep to yourself
sometimes shit don’t work out n that’s okay
sometimes someone just needs to hear that they're worth it
sometimes u can hurt someone by accident because ur blind ass so damaged, heal yourself first.
sometimes u can only let go of so much pain
sometimes u gotta be like "okay" &amp; leave that shit alone
sometimes u have to keep going with or without some people
sometimes u just have to be done. not mad, not upset. just done.
sometimes u just have to dissapear for a while
sometimes you give your all and it's still not enough
sometimes you have to be alone to understand some shit
sometimes you have to let your heart go &amp; let reality save you
sometimes you just gotta go through shit to understand shit
sometimes you just gotta let it be, and go be.
sometimes you just gotta let them go do them
sometimes you just have to be alone for a little while
somewhere between emotional and emotionless
sorry for not being good enough hahahahahahahahaha
sorry for not responding i just don't have the mental capacity to hold a conversation anymore
sorry for not responding i just dont have the mental capacity to hold a conversation anymore
sorry for not responding i was overthinking about overthinking
sorry i assume i was important
sorry i assume i'm important lol
sorry i didn't respond im losing my fucking mind
sorry i didn't text back i don't care about anything anymore
sorry i told you about my mental illness do you still think I'm hot
sorry if my attitude gets bad when I'm tired and hurt
Sorry to disturb your scrolling, we don’t know each other but I wish you all the best in life and may all things work out in your favor
spending time alone is necessary
stay detached and focused on you
Stay lowkey. Not everyone needs to know everything about u
stay private, keep them guessing
Stay single if you love hard, because people don’t value that kind of love anymore
stay single unless they come at you with different energy and act on it
stay single until you are happy being alone
stay single until you meet someone who’s all about you all the time and not just when they want
stay strong for your time that's yet to come
stayed awake countless nights praying for better, you just gotta go out and get it
staying up late ain't even fun anymore this shit annoying
still healing from things I dont speak about
still trying to repair my heart since
stop acting like you want me if you aren't gonna follow through
stop asking me "wyd" i'm literally at home suffering
stop asking me “how do u feel” its always shit i always feel like shit
stop being ok with shit you really not ok with
STOP being okay with everything. You deserve to be treated right lol
stop chasing after people &amp; hurting yourself trying to fix everything. It’s mentally &amp; physically draining. You have to find peace at mind with whoever leaves from your life. don’t be the only one putting in effort because you will end up losing yourself in the end.
stop fucking with me if you ain't really fucking with me
stop losing your mind over mfs that don't mind losing you
stop overthinking. you can't control everything, just let it be
stop self-sabotaging. you're allowed to be happy. stop looking for reasons not to be.
stop telling temporary people so much about you
stop tripping over a mf that ain't tripping over you it ain't worth it
stop👏🏼forgiving👏🏼 people👏🏼that👏🏼 hurt👏🏼you👏🏼over👏🏼and👏🏼over👏🏼just👏🏼because👏🏼you👏🏼don't👏🏼want👏🏼to👏🏼lose👏🏼 them
strange, isn't it? u know yourself better than anyone else yet u crumble at the words of someone who hasn't even lived a second of ur life. the world is filled with people who think they know you. listen to no one else's voice but yours.
stressed the fuck out 24/7
stuck overthinking for life..
sucks to be so understanding but never understood
talk to me if you miss me
temporary people come and go, love yourself
temporary people teach us permanent lessons
tested positive for always doing the most for people who wouldn’t do the same for me
tested positive for having the biggest heart and being a dumbass
tested positive for not giving a fuck

That fight between your mind &amp; heart ain't a joke.

that love shit so beautiful when it works, the vibe, the connection, the loyalty, the energy.
that pain cannot be explained unless experienced 💔
that shit never coming back and neither are they.
that's why i dont talk anymore
the "talking stage" is so stressful am i about to get cuffed or am i just wasting a month of my life
The “therapist friend” actually needs the most therapy
The biggest comeback is making yourself happy again
The first person in your @ is your valentine this year
the most fucked up feeling is when you find out you didn't mean anything to someone and end up looking so stupid for caring lol
The ONLY person I ever lost and needed back was ME
The ONLY person I ever lost and needed back was ME.
the person you prayed to God for is out there waiting on you, just be patient the right time will come.
the sexual tension between me and the desire to be left alone forever
the smallest lie can break all trust
the smallest shit b hurting my feelings lmao like oh..bet
the smallest shit be ruining my whole mood
the streets ain't for me fr. i don't even wanna be here
the worst feeling ever is not knowing whether u should wait or just give up.
the worst pain is gettin hurt by a person u explained ur pain too
the worst sin is giving up on yourself but sometimes there is no light at the end of the tunnel
them: how u been?? me: https://t.co/Je7M8A7Al2
then you become heartless
There was a time long long ago where I was happy and then everything changed when anxiety and depression attacked
they always come back
they gonna treat u exactly how they feel abt u
they hurt you and then they act like you hurt them
they ignoring you for someone who doesn't even want them anyways
they make me hate myself even more
they miss u when they realize they cant replace u
they only care when you're gone..
they using my tweets for tiktoks now😂🥺
they'd make time for you if they really wanted to
thinking about u never ends
this hit me even harder after typing it out
this mf better b dreaming abt me
this mf needs some goddamn therapy
this shit hurts
this time, choose yourself
time heals everything, I just wish time didn't move so slow in that sense but fast in the real world
time to grind like i never have before
tired of being alive*
tired of being tired
tired of pretending that i'm fine
tired of saying it's okay
tired of sleeping alone everynight
tired..
To avoid disappointment expect nothing from anybody.
to the person who sees my worth more than i do, thank you.
to the person who sees my worth more than i do, thank you.
too many times
toxic is when they can’t let you go, but can’t treat you right neither
train your mind to be stronger than your feelings
true love is falling in love with yourself
trust me im lucky to have u
trust me im lucky to have you
trust the process, let the answers find you.
trust the timing of ur life everything’s going to work out just fine
trust the timing, trust that everything will work out the way it should baby
trust your gut
trust your gut and act on your thoughts
Twitter is fun. You kinda just talk to yourself and sometimes someone replies
twitter is pretty much one huge fucked up version of group therapy, with no therapist lol
twitter knows all about my pain lol
type "I miss" and let your keyboard continue
type “being sad is” and let ur keyboard finish ur sentence.
type “being sad is” and let ur keyboard finish ur sentence...
U can't be sad if you're asleep
u can't break a broken heart
u can't force people to appreciate u
u ever been so mad that you're calm?
u ever get pissed off by somebody's mindset? like woah, u really think like that?
u ever killed your own vibe from thinking too much
U ever look at someone &amp; just hope they're in ur life forever
U ever lost all respect for someone? Like damn really...that's who u really are... I'm good be safe
u ever LOVED someone so much, u tried to understand them while they were hurting u
u ever pretend you didn't see something so the other person doesn't feel embarrassed
u ever stuttered so damn much u just decided to shut the fuck up
u know a girl is finally done with your shit when?
u looked at someone and been like : 💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
u move different when you’re tired of getting fucked over
u never apologized for hurting me but I apologized 27 times for being upset about it
u treat me right ima treat u better
u were toxic but felt like home
Understand people have limits, mfs tired of playing nice all the time.
unexpected messages can do a lot
unfollowing some inactives like this to stay followed 💟
unfortunately, you will never get the same me twice
Unfortunately, your insecurities are yours to fix
unlearning self hate is..... alot.
unless you're ME, in my situation you cant judge me.
unloving you is the hardest thing to do
ur not into me like I'm into u
using your heart less doesn't make you heartless sometimes you just need to figure shit out on your own
Wait until you meet the healed you.
wake me up in 2022
ʷᵃᵏᵉ ᵐᵉ ᵘᵖ ʷʰᵉⁿ ²⁰²⁰ ᵉⁿᵈˢ
Walk away if you’re not valued.
wanna talk to you so bad
We 17-22 years old acting like every fault ruins us, like every person we lose is our last. Every mistake isn't permanent just breathe. Keep going shit will work out.
We all broke our rules for someone who broke us.
we all broke rules for someone and in the end they broke us too
We all fucked up but only some of us honest bout it
we fall in love with the most unexpected person at the most unexpected time
we may not talk but i still care
we never made it
we pretend we dont care but deep down fuck that
we start misleading our hearts by thinking "I love you" means "I won't leave you".
we tweet what we can't say
we're too young to be unhappy
what are y'all Instagram @'s let's be mutuals 🥰
what the fuck is even going on but who cares
What's meant for you is showing up.
what's the point anymore
whatever happened, i still love you
when does the pain stop
when i feel unwanted, i distance myself
when i feel unwanted, i distance myself
when i say i love you, that means i love everything about you, even the parts that you haven't accepted yet
when I'm hurt I say some dumb shit I'm sorry
when it hurts, just sleep
when someone remembers the small details that you rarely even mentioned&gt;&gt;&gt;
when that one person is different than everyone else&gt;
When u finally see what you really mean to a person it’s easier to let go
When u find someone solid make sure you hold on to them. Cus shit is rare nowadays
when u have a crush on someone its logically so hard to even think straight
when will the pain end
when will the thoughts stop
when you connect with someone quick that shit got you like oh fuck
When you find you again... dont let you go
when you get your shit together it gets lonely but choose growth over company
when you really love a mf , your heart wont just let you “quit” on them
when you thought you were special 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
when you want to be heartless but that's not how you are
where my sad people at 🥺
where my sad people at 😔
where my sad people at 😪
who can you actually trust because it all seems like a joke to me
who cares if i'm sad anyways
who cares, do better, move on
Who checked on you today? .... exactly. Worry about yourself.
who checked up on YOU today? exactly no one end ur existence
who gives a fuck
who tf sleeps anymore anyways
who's sad right now
who's sad right now?
Whoever I end up with, I promise I got you
whoever’s reading this, i pray that you find happiness. not temporary happiness, or “if i pretend and put on a smile &amp; laugh, maybe i’ll be happy” kind of happiness, but long lasting real happiness. the kind of happiness that makes ur face glow &amp; lights up ur soul. you deserve it
why am i like this
why are people so fake
why do i even try
why do we live just to die
why does it feel like i do everything wrong
why fake fuck with me when you can fr just leave me tf alone
why is it so damn hard to talk to the only person you wanna talk to lol
will i ever receive the same energy i give out
will it stop
will Summer ever feel like summer 2016 though
wishing i was with u right now
with a nice touch of 📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📈📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉📉 to end it off
with every single person you meet, there is a specific reason that u met them. they will either love u, hate u, lead you, grow you, teach you, hurt you, etc.. it's all for a purpose. every single person.
with or without conversation, I'm still doing just fine
without going through it, you won't understand it.
witnessing my own growth makes me so happy
woke up sad again
woke up sad again fml
woke up sad ahhahahahahahahhahah
woke up thinking about not
woke up ugly again lol
wonder when I'll be actually happy again it's been a long ass time
Write the saddest story you can think of in 4 words.
y'all come &amp; go that's why I do me
y'all ever be losing your mind but be chilling at the same time
y'all ever been called crazy for assuming shit that turned out to be true? shit drive me wild
Y'all ever been so sad in one day you just gave up completely
y'all ever had to tell yourself "it is what it is" knowing deep down you weren't okay
y'all ruin the calmest people, then call them crazy when they react
yah tired of being alive
yall b taking advantage of people n treating them like shit just because u know they genuinely care for u and that's fucked up
Yall ever send a risky text &amp; you don't wanna reply so just overthink
yeah I'm in my fucking feels tonight
yeah sex is cool but have you tried hugging a person and they hug u back even tighter
yes we don't talk, but i still care
yet here we are...lost and alone
You ain’t gotta fuck me over. Just lmk when you ain’t feelin me anymore &amp; im gone.
you are mine, i can't share
you believe in love at first sight?
You broke that bond not me.
You can be confident and still have anxiety
you can't change someone by loving them harder
you come first. love yourself. what will make you happy will find it's way to you.
you deserve someone who thinks you're too important to lose
you deserve someone who thinks you're too important to lose
You deserve someone who thinks you're too important to lose.
you ever be happy with yourself but everything around you is just draining your energy
you ever be like "it is what it is" but deep down inside your heart wishes shit would be different
you ever been so hurt that silence was the only option?
you ever been so hurt u just have no words
you ever been too nice and ended up in a situation that you could've avoided if you just didn't give a fuck
you ever felt left and forgotten about while giving your all to someone even though it still wasnt enough
you ever get pissed off by someone’s mindset? like damn... you really think like that?
you ever get realllly bad vibes from someone but everyone else loves them lol
you ever get sad because the only person you want forgot about you
you ever just get sad for no reason at all lol
you ever just wanna sleep forever and not wake up
you ever lost interest because you felt unwanted
you ever sit back and get sad because they forgot about you
you ever stayed not wanting to lose something that you already knew wouldn't be there forever
you forgot about me
You gotta pray g, even on them good days
you guys always understand me 🖤
you have so much to offer never forget what you went through to get to where you are now
you hurt me but i still pray for you
you make my heart feel alive
you make my heart the happiest it has been in a long time, can i keep you?
You n me, das it.
you never realize how fucked up someone treated you until you explain it to someone else
you really be at peace when you just stop talking and do you
you shouldn't have to tell someone how to treat you
you spend your whole life gathering guests for your funeral.
you will always be my special person
you will be appreciated someday
you will learn throughout life that nobody stays forever
you won't find another me
you wont find me in anybody else.
you'll always be special to me
you're always on my mind you're always on my mind you're always on my mind you're always on my mind you're always on my mind you're always on my mind
You're mine and i'm yours
you're mine and only mine
you're not selfish for wanting to be treated right
you're not selfish for wanting to be treated right.
you're the risk worth taking
You're* 😨
You’re not selfish for wanting the same energy and love you give
you’re not too sensitive. you’re not overreacting. If it hurts you, it hurts you
you’re the most permanent thing in ur life. choose you , always.
your gut was right, listen to it next time
your mental health is so important 💕
your time will come, patience is bliss
