# imagination

imagination is driving on a road that never stops
you will never dissipate of gas, you won't be chased by cops
you won't need an oil change, or even an engine check too
but how you drive with this vehicle is all up to you

imagination is driving on a road that never stops
upon this aspalt, you'll observe ideas, inspiration, and even shops
this vehicle will send you anywhere as long as you commit
takes you to the narrow depths of valleys, to the sky eaven touching summits

remember, with imagineation, you will always know,
you can go anywhere you want to go
