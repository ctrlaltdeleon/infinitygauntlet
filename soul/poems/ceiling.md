# ceiling

not much people understand
what it feels like to wake up
to the same ceiling
the same silence

sure people do it everyday
but do they actually know
how it really feels like?
how it is to feel black and white?

it seems as if time stands still, the clock ticks
my eyes are closed, i'm wide awake
i curl up my body, i'm vulnerable
i give a sigh, i give a stern look

i ask the ceiling why it looks at me like that
and slowly, it responds
a harsh silence
an accepted silence
