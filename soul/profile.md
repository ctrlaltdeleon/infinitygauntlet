# values project

- 2014
- strength, positive energy, passion, selflessness
- What values would you like to see practiced by other people toward you?
  - "I would very much enjoy people practicing courtesy and integrity around me. The amount of people who don't practice this is very depressing to me. People should have a good sense of what a good person is through the values of courtesy and integrity. In general, to be kind and to be humble. I would love to see this happen."
- What is your career goal?
  - "My career goal is to be a computer programmer for groups such as Microsoft, Riot Games, or Blizzard. I would also enjoy working on security systems and anything that would benefit the people as a whole. I know the one and only value that ties in incredibly well to these goals would be commitment."
- What was the single most important thing you learned in this class?
  - "Moderation. Not only does it occur in health, but in relationships, events, hobbies, everything."
