# values project

- 2014
  - strength, positive energy, passion, selflessness
  - what values would you like to see practiced by other people toward you?
    - "i would very much enjoy people practicing courtesy and integrity around me. the amount of people who don't practice this is very depressing to me. people should have a good sense of what a good person is through the values of courtesy and integrity. in general, to be kind and to be humble. i would love to see this happen."
  - what is your career goal?
    - "my career goal is to be a computer programmer for groups such as microsoft, riot games, or blizzard. i would also enjoy working on security systems and anything that would benefit the people as a whole. i know the one and only value that ties in incredibly well to these goals would be commitment."
  - what was the single most important thing you learned in this class?
    - "moderation. not only does it occur in health, but in relationships, events, hobbies, everything."
