## 1: Case

`NZXT H1`

- This is a small form factor case which I wanted for more real estate on the desk.
- Easy to build with from the review videos I've seen.

## 2: Central Processing Unit (CPU)

`AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 3.6 GHz 8-Core Processor`

- Main reason was budget and getting something enough to do everything.
  - Game.
  - Edit.
  - Stream.
- Also have been using AMD, been enjoying so far.
- Heard many strides AMD has been doing with Ryzen, combating Intel as a competitor.

## 2.1: CPU Cooler

`NZXT Kraken X42 140mm AIO Liquid Cooler with RGB`

- The NZXT H1 comes with it's own cooler so no need to choose.

## 3: Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

`Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER 8 GB WINDFORCE OC 3X Video Card`

- Went with the RTX 2070 Super over the RX 5700 XT.
  - Main reason is fan sound and specs, but the drawback is paying more.

## 4: Memory (RAM)

`G.Skill Trident Z RGB 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR4-3600 Memory`

- Consider using 2 sticks instead of 1 due to dual channel memory.
  - Impacts speed.

## 5: Motherboard

`Asus ROG Strix B450-I Gaming`

- The problem with AMD motherboards at the moment is that they don't provide a USB-C friendly option.

## 6: Peripherals

## 6.1: Headset

`CORSAIR VIRTUOSO RGB WIRELESS (WHITE)`

- About 8 hours of battery life.
- Comes with 3 ways to connect.
  - AUX cord.
  - USB.
  - Wirelessly.

## 6.2: Keyboard

`Velocifire TKL61WS`

- Wanted a lightweight keyboard that provided me an introduction to 60% keyboards.

## 6.3: Microphone

`CORSAIR VIRTUOSO RGB WIRELESS (WHITE)`

- Using the headset for the microphone.
  - It's good enough.
  - Portable!

## 6.4: Monitor

`VIOTEK GN27D 27.0" 2560x1440 144 Hz Monitor`

- Cheapest monitor I could find that had what I wanted.
  - Curved.
  - 1440p.
  - 144hz.
  - 27".
- Drawback is that the stand is static, but I didn't mind that since I was looking for monitor mounts.

## 6.5: Mouse

`Razer Viper Ultimate`

- Wanted something wireless, but can go wired if need be.
- Able to charge through a hub that comes with it.
- RGB!

## 6.6: Mousepad

`N/A`

- N/A

## 7: Power Supply Unit (PSU)

`NZXT 650W SFF Gold PSU`

- The NZXT H1 comes with it's own PSU.
- Gold is the sweet spot for the 80 plus efficiency program

## 8: Storage

`Western Digital Blue 1 TB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive`

- Motherboard supports this.
- 1 TB is a decent amount size for whatever I need to do.

## 9: Extras

`Windows 10 Home`

- Operating system needed.
- No need for pro since we won't be utilizing all of the features, home is good enough.

## 10: Notes

- Dimensions for case: (Depth x Width x Height)
  - Previous case (NZXT Phantom): 623 mm x 222 mm x 540 mm
  - Ideally wanted something smaller than that.
- Lian Li Strimer+ Cables were potential.
  - Provides RGB lighting for the cables.
