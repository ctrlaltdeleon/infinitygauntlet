# Introduction

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems. They are not classes, packages, or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

# What types of design patterns are there?

## Creational!

- Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.
- Types of creational patterns:
  - Factory Method.
  - Abstract Factory.
  - Builder.
  - Prototype.
  - Singleton.

## Structural!

- Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other.
- "How to build a software component?"
- Types of structural patterns:
  - Adapter.
  - Bridge.
  - Composite.
  - Decorator.
  - Facade.
  - Flyweight.
  - Proxy.

## Behavioral!

- It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them.
- "How to run a behavior in software component?"
- Types of behavioral patterns:
  - Chain of Responsibility.
  - Command.
  - Interpreter.
  - Iterator.
  - Mediator.
  - Memento.
  - Observer.
  - Visitor.
  - Strategy.
  - State.
  - Template Method.
