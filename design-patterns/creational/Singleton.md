# SINGLETON

## What is it?

- It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.
- Instead of the hiring manager interviewing all candidates, have specialized interviewers interview sections of candidates.

## When to use?

- Useful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required sub-class is dynamically decided at runtime.
- Or putting it in other words, when the client doesn't know what exact sub-class it might need.
- In this case, when the hiring manager doesn't know what exact managers needed to interview candidates.
