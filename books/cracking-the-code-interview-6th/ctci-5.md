# CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW

## 5: Behavioral Questions

### Interview Preparation Grid

- Have 3 separate projects for each of the common questions.
  - Challenges
  - Mistakes/Failures
  - Enjoyed
  - Leadership
  - Conflicts
  - What You'd Do Differently

### What are your weaknesses?

- Give a real weakness.
  - "Attention to detail, due to that I need someone to check my work."
  - "Water because I'm a Fire type Pokemon"
  - "There's a bunch of obstacles out there I need to face such as this interview, but I choose not to see them as weaknesses, but more as opportunities to grow."
  - "It takes me a bit to know people and situations before I weigh in on something they're discussing. I'm usually listening and analyzing, but when I contribute I make it worthwhile and sometimes it takes a while to find that balance for me."
- Also could be treated as "Where do you need to improve?"

### What questions should you ask the interviewer?

- Genuine questions:
  - "What is the ratio of testers to devs to program managers?"
  - "How does project planning happen on the team?"
  - "What brought you to this company?"
- Insightful questions:
  - "I noticed you use tech X, how do you handle problem Y?"
  - "Why do you tend to go with this stack as aside from this stack?"
- Passion questions:
  - "I can see the areas of growth here, but what about in the future?"
  - "I'm not familiar with tech X, could you tell me more?"

### Know your Technical Projects

- Focus on 2 or 3 technical projects to master.
- Be able to talk about:
  - Your role.
  - Mistakes made along the way.
  - Technical depth.
  - Scalability.
  - Challenges.

### Responding to Behavioral Questions

- Be specific, not arrogant.
  - Don't say "I did all the hard stuff".
  - To combat this, be specific about the challenges and have empathy.
- Limit details.
  - Sometimes the interviewer doesn't know what you know.
  - Keep it elementary and offer to explain more as a choice to them.
- Focus on yourself, not your team.
  - Although it's nice to say "we", when asked specifically about a role, focus on you.
  - Give structured answers:
    - Nugget V.S. SAR (Situation, Action, Result) (Also known as STAR or CAR)
- Explore the action:
  - Concentrate on the "action" part more than anything else.
  - Interviewer needs to know what you did, not what happened.
- Think about what it says:
  - Initiative/Leadership!
  - Empathy!
  - Compassion!
  - Humility!
  - Teamwork/Helpfulness!
  - Overall, try to convey that you're a wholesome person.

### So tell me about yourself...

- Structure:
  - Current role:
    - "I'm a software engineer..."
  - College:
    - "I went to..."
  - Post college & onwards:
    - "Now I am..."
  - Current role:
    - "I'm a software engineer at..."
  - Outside of work:
    - "I do hackathons...:
  - Wrap up:
    - "I'm now here looking for opportunities..."
  - Hobbies:
    - Think carefully about this as you may/may not want to discuss them.
    - Unique:
      - Fire breathing.
    - Technical:
      - Computer building.
      - Audio engineering.
    - Positive personality attribute:
      - Powerlifting.
- Sprinkle in shows of successes:
  - Think about what you want to communicate about yourself.
  - Have little tid bits every now and here that are shown here.
