# JAVA FOR DUMMIES

## 3: Using the Basic Building Blocks

### The words in a Java program

- Java has two kinds of words:
  - Keywords.
    - "person"
    - "if, else"
  - Identifiers.
    - "Sam"
    - "bread, pizza"
- Everything is case sensitive so be mindful of naming conventions.

### The Java Class

- Java forces you to use classes and objects when starting a project.
- A class is bigger than a method, a method is bigger than a statement.

### And Now, a Few Comments

- Traditional comments:
  - `/* comment */`
- End-of-line comments:
  - `// comment`
- Javadoc comments:
  - `/\*_ comment _/
