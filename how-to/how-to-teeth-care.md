I'm a dentist.

I posted this a while back but it should answer your questions about dental care products in general.

"For toothbrushes, electric is the way to go. Oral b or sonicare are great. I prefer oral b because the heads are smaller and its easier to maneuver around each tooth but it's a preference thing. I strongly suggest electric to all of my patients.

For toothpaste, brand doesn't really matter as long as it has fluoride in it. Also, the "whitening" toothpastes don't really whiten the way white strips do. The toothpaste whitening just polishes away surface enamel stains. Regular whitening (ie. Crest whitening strips, Zoom, etc.) uses carbamide or hydrogen peroxide to penetrate the enamel and whiten dentin (the second layer which is the layer mostly responsible for the color of your teeth). Some toothpastes do have hydrogen or carbamide peroxide but the concentration is so low it is negligible in its effect. Another pointer is the inoffice whitening (Zoom) is the same as the take home stuff (whitestrips) except the concentration is higher so it whitens faster. In my opinion, save yourself $250-500 and just do the OTC whitening kits. It'll make your teeth less sensitive after and you still get the same results.

For patients with sensitive teeth, use sensodyne or anything with 5% potassium nitrate. Be careful though, sensitivity may be a sign of more serious issues such as cavities or gum disease so make sure you go to a dentist regularly.

For mouth wash, I recommend ACT or listerine total (light purple). I can't stress it enough. Fluoride is your friend. If you have small incipient cavities in the enamel, fluoride can repair these areas and actually make them stronger. If bad breath is the issue, Scope is best.

As for floss...the strings are technically better than the pickers (aka pick floss) because you can introduce "deep pocket" bacteria into healthy areas since you're using the same small piece of floss all over your mouth. However, more people would rather use the pickers which is better than nothing. I suggest at least rinsing the picker between each tooth to try and keep it relatively clean. My theory is that as long as you're removing the plaque between your teeth, you're alright."
