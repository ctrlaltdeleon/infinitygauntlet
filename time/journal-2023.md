- https://codefrontend.com/debounce-throttle-js-react/#what-is-throttling
- Debouncing is a technique used to improve the performance of frequently executed actions, by delaying them, grouping them, and only executing the last call.
  - Use debounce when you don't care about the intermediate results because the action only makes sense with the last result. An example of that is - search results.
  - Typing.
  - Button clicks.
- Throttling is a technique used to improve the performance of frequently executed actions, by limiting the rate of execution. It is similar to debounce, except it guarantees the regular execution of an action.
  - Use throttle when you need intermediate results, but a small delay is acceptable. For example, resizing or scrolling.
  - Resizing a window.

- `.blur()` is only guaranteed to exist on HTMLElements, not all Elements. I have frequently seen exceptions caused by unguarded `document.activeElement.blur()`, because `document.activeElement` was an SVG element rather than HTML.

```jsx
// A potential fix to ensure the element can be blurred.
if (document.activeElement instanceof HTMLElement) {
  document.activeElement.blur();
}
```

- Error: `Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'HTMLDivElement | null'.`

```jsx
// A potential fix.
const componentRef = useRef < HTMLDivElement > null;
```
