# loving

floating restfully upon the sky,
this sperical, shimmering rock caught my eye
my eye hooked to it, like seeing a gorgeous girl,
makes me want to prance, makes me want to twirl

i examine this wonder that lies deep in space,
i hear its symphony with all its grace
now as it disappears, fades away from my sight,
i can't wait to witness this wonder the consequent night
