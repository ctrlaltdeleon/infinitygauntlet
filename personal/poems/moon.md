# moon

you deserve better
that's what they say
i convince myself to say that too
but don't you know?

they were my moon
the reason why i slept well at night
it was all because of them
knowing someone was there for me

when morning arose
we parted ways
then i realize as time goes by
you're not the same as you used to be

new moon
full moon
different types of moons
you were the moon, but it's hard to remember

what am i saying?
it's not hard to remember
but it's hard to forget
you're still my moon
