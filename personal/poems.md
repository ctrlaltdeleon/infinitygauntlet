   1. ???
   2. cars go by
   3. absorbing the unwanted memories
   4. i feel this pain
   5. you were the umbrella
   6. and also the rain
2. two
   1. ???
   2. how could i even compare
   3. how she made me felt
   4. i was a drop in the ocean
   5. and she was the storm

   2. away
   3. stay
4. ???
   1. like a tree that falls in a forest without a sound
   2. i can't say i exist when you're not around

   1. i remember your smile with the sun in your eyes,
   2. and the smell of the summer, the sound of the breeze -
   3. i remember your shape under powder-blue skies;
   4. under wandering clouds; under whispering trees.
   5. i remember the feel of the grass at our back,
   6. and the touch of its warmth, and the cool of the shade,
   7. and the calls of our friends from the river-way track,
   8. and the season that last for an age when it stayed.
   9. i remember the fire we built of a night,
   10. and the sight of the stars as they slipped in a stream,
   11. and the furtive first-kiss that we shared by its light,
   12. and the simple, impossible, innocent dream.
   13. i remember you most in the starlight above,
   14. but for you it was fun - and for me it was love.
   15. so please don't break my heart like those before
   16. because you are the one i truly adore
