### Fluids

  - Seal tight!
- Pay attention to either DOT3 or DOT4 fluids being required.
- Pay attention to the color of the fluid as well, darker means more caution to change, but isn't a binary situation.
- This type of fluid is hydroscopic which means it absorbs water which we don't want.
- **There are hydroscopic testers which test the amount of water inside the container.**
  - When the fluid exceeds the copper limit or moisture limit, you change it.

#### Engine oil:

- Changing directions:
  - Have an empty pan ready under the car to catch fluids.
  - Loosen bolt.
  - Once liquids are empty, tighten bolt.
  - Replace engine oil filter with new one.

#### Windshield washer fluid:

- Changing directions:

- Use windshield antifreeze fluid if in very freezing places to avoid frosting.
- Any windshield fluid should suffice.

    - Use a penny, Lincoln's head upside down, in the tire trenches.
    - If you can see Lincoln's head, it's time to change the tire.
  - Also be mindful of cracks on the tire, more cracks = need to change.
- How to check air tire pressure and fill tires with air?
  - Go to gas station, ask attendant to turn on the air machine.
  - The machine should have an air pressure gauge attached.
