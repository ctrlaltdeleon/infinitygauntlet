- In Linux, `lshw` means "list hardware".
- What are WebSockets?
  - They allow long-held single TCP socket connection to be established between the client and server which allows for bi-directional full duplex, messages to be instantly distributed with little overhead resulting in a very low latency connection.
- What is TCP?
  - Transmission Control Protocol.
  - A "guaranteed" standard in which two computers can communicate.
- What is IP?
  - Internet Protocol.
  - Unique addresses so applications know where to send the data.
- What is UDP?
  - User Datagram Protocol.
  - A "non-guaranteed" standard in which two computers can communicate.
- What is TCP/IP
  - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
  - Specifically allows two specific computers to communicate.
- Why are WebSockets important?
  - Being able to create functionality that works consistently across multiple platforms.
- What is AJAX?
  - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
  - A certain way to make a HTTP request.
  - Being able to update an application without reloading the whole application.
- What is HTTP?
  - HyperText Transfer Protocol.
  - Defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.
- WebSockets VS AJAX?
  - AJAX should still be used for making short-lived web service calls.
  - WebSockets should be used when relying on latency and connection constraints.
- What is WebSockets compared to HTTP?
  - WebSockets is an extension of HTTP, which is an extension of TCP.
- What is a web page?
  - A document which can be displayed in a web browser.
- What is a website?
  - A collection of web pages.
- What is a web server?
  - A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.
- What is a search engine?
  - A web service that helps users find other web pages.
- How is the internet connected?
  - Computer > Router > Modem > Internet Service Provider > Antennas
- What are web servers?
  - Contains files and HTTP server.
  - Stores an application's files and controls how web users accesses hosted files.
- What's a `static` web server?
  - A stack, computer, with an HTTP server with files to be taken "as-is".
- What's a dynamic web server?
  - A `static` web server with extra software, usually an application server and a database.
  - It's dynamic because the application server updates the hosted files before sending them to the application itself.

- What are B-Trees?
  - A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
  - Well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as discs.
  - It is commonly used in databases and file systems.
- What are the differences between b-trees and binary trees?
  - B-Trees:
    - A node can have at max "m" number of child nodes (where "m" is the order of the tree).
    - Stored on a disk.
    - Code indexing data structure in many DBMS.
  - Binary Trees:
    - A node can have at max 2 number of sub-trees.
    - Stored in RAM.
    - Code optimization, Huffman coding, etc.
- What is Huffman coding?
  - An optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression.
- What is paging in terms of computer science?
  - A memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage (disk) for use in main memory (RAM).
- When would you use a binary heap VS binary search tree?
  - Binary heap is better at `min`/`max` with a `O(1)` search time, while binary search tree is balanced with a `O(log n)` search time for any node.
  - If you only care about `min`/`max` (e.g. priority-related), go with binary heap.
  - If you want everything sorted, go with binary search tree.
- What's the difference between a heap VS binary heap?
  - They're the same.
- What's the difference between a binary tree VS binary search tree?
  - Binary tree is where a parent node has at max 2 children.
  - Binary search tree is the same as a binary tree, but balanced/sorted, meant for searching in `O(log n)` time.
- Can you store a dictionary within a dictionary?
  - Yes.
- Interview.

# September 26 2019

- How do you take a string as it is (raw) in `Python`?
  - `r"this will 'be' read \n"`
- Can functions be more than functions?
  - Yes, they can be treated as objects with attributes attached.
- Interview.

```py
def gcd(a, b):
    gcd.counter += 1
    if (a == b):
        return a
    if (a < b):
        return gcd(a, b - a)
    else:
        return gcd(a - b, b)


# Giving the function `gcd` a class attribute of `counter`.
gcd.counter = 0
print("gcd():", gcd(15, 21))
print("Amount of times function is called:", gcd.counter)
```

- What is breadth first search (BFS)?
  - Looks at all things that are a certain distance away before increasing that distance.
- What is depth first search (DFS)?
  - Looks at all the way down one path before going back to look at another path.
- What's the difference between both BFS and DFS?
  - Think about a radar that has 4 quadrants.
  - BFS is looking by expanding the radius.
  - DFS is looking by each quadrant.

- How does one properly call class methods in `Python`?

```py
class Solution():

    def add(self, num1, num2):
        return num1 + num2

# Create an instance of the class first to then access the methods.
# Can't do `Solution.add(5, 6)` because there's no object attached.
s = Solution()
print(s.add(5, 6))
# Expect `11`.
```

- How does one reverse a string in `Python` without the use of `reverse()` or `[::-1]`?

```py
def reverseThis(text):
    return text if len(text) <= 1 else reverse(textThis[1:]) + text[0]
```

- Interview.

# September 18 2019

- What is a binary search?
  - Also known as a half-interval search.
  - For the search to be binary, the array must be sorted initially.
  - Establishes a mid point and looks if the target is `<`,`>`, or `==` and then proceeds to divide the search by two each iteration until the target is found.
- What is a heap?
  - A tree-based data structure where the nodes are in a specific order dependent in priority.
  - Essentially a priority queue.
  - If a max-heap was made, it would have the biggest elements at the top.
  - If a min-heap was made, it would have the smallest elements at the top.
- How do you put `""` within `""`?

```py
# Using single and double quotes together.
print('"A word that needs quotation marks"')

# Escape the double quotes within the string.
print("\"A word that needs quotation marks\"")

# Use triple-quoted strings.
print(""" "A word that needs quotation marks" """)
```

- Recursion VS iteration?
  - For high-level approaches, recursion is easier to understand than iteration.
  - For low-level approaches, iteration runs smoother (less memory) than recursion.
- What's a hash table (hash map)?
  - A data structure that provides a specific way to map keys to values.
  - `Python` has a similar structure called a dictionary.
- What's a tree?
  - A data structure that simulates a hierarchy with parent nodes and children nodes that are linked together.
- Array VS list?
  - Array:
    - Fixed.
    - Hard to insert/shuffle because it takes memory and moving multiple parts.
    - Static and continuous.
    - Lookup time fast due to indexed values.
  - List:
    - Organically growing.
    - Easy to insert/shuffle as you would just need to change what points to what.
    - Dynamic and random.
    - Lookup time slow due to going one node at a time.
- Met up with a friend.

- How does `continue` work?
  - If met, skips the following leftover code in the block and goes through the iteration again.

```js
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}

// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
```

- How do you look for the first `<p>` element and modify it?

```js
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementsByTag("p")[0].innerHTML = "Hello";
</script>
```

- How do you change the first element via `class`?

```js
<p class="test"></p>
<p class="test"></p>

<script>
document.getElementsByClassName("test")[0].innerHTML = "Hello";
</script>
```

- How do you change the `src` of an `img` element?
  - Treat it as if it's an object with properties that can be manipulated.

```js

<img id="image" src="smiley.gif">

<script>
document.getElementById("image").src = "pic-mountain.jpg";
</script>
```

- How do you change the text color of a specific `id`?

```js
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "red";
</script>
```

- Differences between `const`, `let`, and `var`?
  - `const` is enclosed to the block it's in w/o re-assignment.
    - This doesn't mean an object's values can't be changed, it's just the object itself.
  - `let` is enclosed to the block it's in.
  - `var` is enclosed to the function it's in.

```js
const name = "AC";
name = "Nope"; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const obj = {};
obj.a = 42;
console.log(obj.a); // 42

var globalVariable = 42;
let blockScopedVariable = 43;

console.log(globalVariable); // 42
console.log(blockScopedVariable); // 43

console.log(this.globalVariable); // 42
console.log(this.blockScopedVariable); // undefined

- What is a microservice?
  - It focuses on a single business capability.
  - Each has their own data service instead of one monolithic data area.
- Why use microservice?
  - Makes systems loosely coupled.
  - No need to disassemble the whole engine, just a single part causing a malfunction.
  - Most common method of communication is `HTTP` and messaging.
- What makes a great microservice?
  - Make communication stateless:
    - Each pair of request and response communication makes an independent transaction.
    - Gives the ability to scale.

- What is the life cycle of a `ReactJS` component?
  - Birth/Mount.
  - Growth/Update.
  - Death/Unmount.
- What is the difference between props and state?
  - Props is passed down by a parent component.
  - State is attached to the relevant component.
- What is a callback?
  - A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing.

```js
// Example.
function doHomework(subject, callback) {
  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
  callback();
}

function alertFinished() {
  alert("Finished!");
}

doHomework("math", alertFinished);
```

```js
// Twitter API example.
T.get("search/tweets", params, function (err, data, response) {
  if (!err) {
    // This is where the magic will happen.
  } else {
    console.log(err);
  }
});
```

- What are unique about functions in JavaScript?
  - Functions are objects.
  - Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments and be returned by other functions.
  - These in such are called higher-order functions.
  - Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.
- Facebook interview prep.

- What are scoped packages?
  - A package name tied to a specific author.
  - `"name": "@acfromspace/weeb"`
  - The `@acfromspace` before the `/weeb` allows for scoped packages to be made as opposed to if we just made `"name": weeb`, which may be unavailable.
- What is semantic versioning?
  - When updating software it goes by `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
  - `MAJOR` version when making incompatible API changes.
  - `MINOR` version when adding functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
  - `PATCH` version when making backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- Comments are not allowed in `.JSON` files!
- Packages made in `npm` are automatically private unless said otherwise.
  - Fixed with `npm publish --access=public`.

- What does it mean if there's a `super()` within a constructor?
  - `super()` is used to call the constructor, methods and properties of parent class.
  - In `ReactJS`, if utilizing a subclass `super()` is always called because ES6 class constructors must call it.
    - To utilize `this` keyword, `super()` is needed to know what to reference, such for the common `this.props`.

- What is the difference between `npm` and `npx`?
  - `npm` installs packages.
  - `npx` executes packages without needing to install on your computer.
- Why would I use `npx` over `npm`?
  - Usually for `create-react-app`, instead of constantly updating the package on your computer then executing, you could just execute the latest version on the cloud every time.
  - Saves a few steps.
- What files are required for a `ReactJS` project to execute?
  - `public/index.html` for the page template.
  - `src/index.js` for the `JavaScript` entry point.
- How do you implement a `<script>` within a `ReactJS` component?

```js
componentDidMount() {
  const script = document.createElement("script");
  script.src = "www.cornify.com/js/cornify.js";
  script.async = true;
  document.body.appendChild(script);
}

- `C#` training.
- ELI5 GraphQL!
  - The problem before is having multiple "dumb" endpoints recieving data which slowed down an application.
    - I need to go get a pizza, get groceries, and my dry cleaning.
  - The solution is having a single "smart" endpoint that can take complex queries.
    - GraphQL, please do these things and come back when you're done.
  - GraphQL also gets specific details, instead of a whole store which thus reduces requests and payloads.
- Naming conventions for variables within a class?
  - Within the class itself, put an `_` in front of the variable.
    - `double _balance`.
  - Leave the parameters asynchronous with the way they're called from class to class.

# June 10 2019

- `C#` training.
- What is the difference between `public`, `protected`, `private`, `static`, and `void`?
  - `public` is a method accessible by anyone.
  - `protected` is a method accessible within the class and subclasses.
  - `private` is a method accessible within the class.
  - `static` is a method accessible without an instance of the class.
  - `void` is a method without a return value.
- `.NET` core VS `.NET` framework VS Xamarin?
  - Core is for cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux), microservices, best performance and scale.
  - Framework is for monolithic applications on Windows.
  - Xamarin is for mobile devices.
- What is AAA?
  - Arrange.
    - Setup the needed environment to test.

- What is MVC and how does it work?
  - MVC is model view controller, a design pattern for web applications.
  - Model is the data.
    - A boba shop has many different types of drinks in inventory (model).
  - View is the presentation of data.
    - The customer is viewing the menu and pictures of said drinks (view).
  - Controller is the logic of the application.
    - The owner presents the boba to the customer (controller).
- What is `C#`?
  - General purpose object-oriented programming language.
  - Created by Microsoft.
  - Part of the many languages used with `.NET`.
  - Relatively easy to learn.
- What is `.NET`?
  - Framework for building Windows applications (and web apps).
  - Not limited to `C#`.
  - Consists of Common Language Runtime (CLR) & Class Library.
    - Gives reusable classes and methods.
- What is CLR?
  - Virtual machine component.

- What are differences between stack and heap?
  - Stack:
    - Uses `static` memory.
    - Stores local variables and function calls.
    - May have stack overflow if memory has run out.
    - Limited.
  - Heap:
    - Uses dynamic memory.
    - Stores changing object data.
    - May have fragmentation if allocating too much memory.
    - Unlimited (kind of).
- In `C#`, for a method to be overridden, the base class must have `virtual` to a method so the sub class can `override` the method.

# May 28 2019

- What's the difference between `static` VS non-`static` methods?
  - `Static` methods must be called with the class name `Math.Pow()`.
    - This is kind to processing power and allows a "one and done" mentality.
  - Non-static methods are attached to the object the class it inherits from.
    - For example, `object.addCoolNumbers()` may rely on other information provided with the object.
- Operator overloading?
  - Defines custom actions for operators.
  - Say you have two object boxes, an example of operator overloading is `Box b3 = b1 + b2`.
- What are structs?
  - Structs is a value type used to encapsulate small groups of related variables.
  - Much like classes, but limited to variables and no inheritance.

  - `double` is 64 bit (15-16 digits).
  - `decimal` is 128 bit (28-29 significant digits).
- When would you use `float`, `double`, and `decimal`?
  - `float` for graphics due to high processing power.
  - `double` for everything else.
  - `decimal` for financial apps.

- What's `ReactJS Hooks`?
  - If you're familiar with `ReduxJS`, it's a state management system for your app.
  - It's slowly being included in `ReactJS`, previous being `ReactJS Context`, but `ReactJS Hooks` provides a more fulfilling role.
- `ReactJS Hooks` replacing `ReduxJS` seems to be a hot topic nowadays, it'll depend more on what each has to offer as `ReactJS Hooks` is new.

# May 17 2019

- When would you use `shouldComponentUpdate`?
  - When something is being updated, but don't want to re-render.
  - When something about the application starts to feel slow.
  - Downside is that if implemented incorrectly, many bugs may arise.
- When do you make a component reusable?
  - When it's being re-written in other components (more than 1).
- At what point is a component too big?
  - A component is too big if it's doing more than 1 job.
- When do you split a component into several smaller components?
  - A component is split into several smaller components when reusable components are predictable as well as simplifying unit testing.
- What is `ReactJS Context`?
  - Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass `props` down manually at every level.
- What are some use cases for `ReactJS Context`?

```js
// Without ReactJS Context.
class App extends ReactJS.Component {
  render() {
    return <Toolbar theme="dark" />;
  }
}

function Toolbar(props) {
  // The Toolbar component must take an extra "theme" prop
  // and pass it to the ThemedButton. This can become painful
  // if every single button in the app needs to know the theme
  // because it would have to be passed through all components.
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton theme={props.theme} />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends ReactJS.Component {
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.props.theme} />;
  }
}

// WITH REACT CONTEXT!

// Context lets us pass a value deep into the component tree
// without explicitly threading it through every component.
// Create a context for the current theme (with "light" as the default).
const ThemeContext = ReactJS.createContext("light");

class App extends ReactJS.Component {
  render() {
    // Use a Provider to pass the current theme to the tree below.
    // Any component can read it, no matter how deep it is.
    // In this example, we're passing "dark" as the current value.
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

// A component in the middle doesn't have to
// pass the theme down explicitly anymore.
function Toolbar(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends ReactJS.Component {
  // Assign a contextType to read the current theme context.
  // ReactJS will find the closest theme Provider above and use its value.
  // In this example, the current theme is "dark".
  static contextType = ThemeContext;
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.context} />;
  }
}
```

- `ReactJS Context` VS `ReactJS ReduxJS`, when should I use each one?
  - If you're only using `ReduxJS` to avoid passing down `props`, context could replace `ReduxJS` - but then you probably didn't need `ReduxJS` in the first place.
  - `Context` also doesn't give you anything like the `ReduxJS DevTools`, the ability to trace your state updates, middleware to add centralized application logic, and other powerful capabilities that `ReduxJS` enables.
- How does one handle errors in `ReactJS`?
  - Without specification from the developer, that page will turn blank to prevent spilling any info to malicious users.

```js
// Error handler component.

class ErrorHandler extends ReactJS.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { errorOccurred: false };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    this.setState({ errorOccurred: true });
    logErrorToMyService(error, info); // If you use a service such as Sentry, Roller, Airbrake, or others.
  }

  render() {
    return this.state.errorOccurred ? (
      <h1>Something went wrong!</h1>
    ) : (
      this.props.children
    );
  }
}

// Then wrap the component being monitored for errors like so.

<ErrorHandler>
  <SomeOtherComponent />
</ErrorHandler>;
```

- What is the difference between an action, and an action creator in `ReduxJS`?
  - An action is a payload of information we send to the store.
  - An action creator is a function that creates and returns an action.

```js
// Action.

type Action = {
  type: string, // Actions MUST have a type.
  payload?: any, // Actions MAY have a payload.
  meta?: any, // Actions MAY have meta information.
  error?: boolean, // Actions MAY have an error field.
  // When true, payload SHOULD contain an Error.
};

// Action creator.

const getUserDetailsRequest = (id) => ({
  type: Actions.GET - USER - DETAILS - REQUEST,
  payload: id,
});
```

- What is the `ReduxJS` store?
  - The whole state of the app in an immutable object tree.
- Why use the `ReduxJS` store?
  - Instead of passing `props` consistently down to all children, the children can just reference the store to reduce complexity.
- What's a reducer?
  - Specify how the app's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
  - Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.
- How does unit testing work?
  - Usually through use of testing libraries.

```js
// Example of unit testing using Enzyme.

describe('<MyComponent />', () => {
  it('Renders three <Wow /> components!', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);
    expect(wrapper.find(Wow)).to.have.lengthOf(3);
  });
```

- Remember to fix the `PATH` when using `Visual Studio Code` to reference compilers (especially with `Python`)!
- What are advantages of `ReactJS`?
  - Increase application performance.
  - Easily integrated with other frameworks.
- What are disadvantages of `ReactJS`?
  - Just a library, not a full framework.
  - Library is large and takes time to understand.
  - Difficult for novice programmers to understand.
  - Code gets complex through inline templating and `JSX`.
- What is `JSX`?
  - `JavaScript XML`.
  - A `ReactJS` extension that allows to write `JavaScript` that looks like `HTML`.

```jsx
render() {
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>This is JSX!</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- Difference between `componentWillReceiveProps` and `componentWillUpdate`?
  - `componentWillReceiveProps` is called before `componentWillUpdate`.
  - `componentWillReceiveProps` allows to `setState`.
  - `componentWillUpdate` allows a response to the `setState` change.
- What is business logic in terms of computer software?
  - Part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determines how data can be create, displayed, stored, and changed.
  - Usually falls into these 3 categories:
    - Verification. (Identifying the user accessing what.)
    - Transformation. (Augmenting what the user can do.)
    - Processing. (How the data gets transferred securely.)
- When is it appropriate to use component state VS `ReduxJS` store?
  - If a component just needs to display data and can receive data from a parent, use `ReduxJS` store.
  - Otherwise if it needs the state, use component state.

# May 15 2019

- What is `ReactJS`?
  - ReactJS is a front-end `JavaScript` library developed by Facebook in 2011.
  - It follows component based approach which helps in reusable UI components.

  - Virtual DOM.
  - Server-side rendering.
  - Uni-directional data flow.
- What's a DOM?
  - Document Object Model.
  - Gives characteristics to specific parts of an application.
  - It's a tree.

```

- What is `jQuery`?
  - A library of `JavaScript` functions that make it easier to do common tasks such as:
    - Manipulating webpage.
    - Responding to user events.
    - Getting data from servers.
    - Building effects and animation.

```js
// JavaScript.

var images = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
for (var i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {
  images[i].style.width = "50px";
}

// JQuery.

$("img").width(50);
```

- How do you do a `fetch` call in `JavaScript`?

```js
// Enclosed in a <script></script>.

var apiUrl = "%WHERE-THE-FILE-IS%";
fetch(apiUrl)
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Work with the JSON data here: ", data);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("Work with the errors here:", err);
  });
```

- How should someone load a `.json` onto `HTML` ?
  - By using fragments so that when a large data set comes, it'll be pieced together rather than waiting for the whole load.
- Difference between `margin` and `padding`?
  - `Margin` takes place outside the `border`.
  - `Padding` takes place inside the `border`.
- How does `padding` work in terms of placement?
  - Think like the top of a clock.
  - `padding: top right bottom left;`

# May 12 2019

- `<div class="">` VS `<div id="">`?
  - `class` is applied to many things (`.someClass`).
  - `id` is specific for 1 area (`#someID`).
- What is best practice for `<div class="">` VS `<div id="">`?
  - Usually want to `id` things such as `header`, `footer`, `sidebar` because there's only 1 `header` as such.
  - For something like `card`, a `class` would be wonderful because there is usually more than 1 `card` on a webpage.
- What happens if you use both `<div class="">` and `<div id="">`?
  - `id` will take precedence over the `class` selectors.
  - In the below code, `Hello!` would be red.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<p id="intro" class="foo">Hello!</p>
```

```css
/* style.css */

#intro {
  color: red;
}
.foo {
  color: blue;

- What does `HTML` mean?
  - HyperText Markup Language.
- `HTML5` VS `HTML`?
  - `HTML5` offers more such as new tags `<canvas>`. `<video>`, `<audio>`, and more bring much more.
  - `HTML` does not, but still is supported on all browsers as opposed to the updated `HTML5` which doesn't.

- What is overloading?
  - When you have the same function taking in different parameters.
- Why would you use overloading?

```java
void println_emptyLine()
void println_boolean(boolean x)
void println_character(char x)

// With overloading...

void println()
void println(boolean x)
void println(char x)

// MOTIVATES CLEAN CODE!
```

- Does `Python` support overloading?
  - No, it's because you don't need to, it's flexible with default values.
- What is overriding?
  - When you have an inherited function, but would like to have it do something else.
- Why would you use overriding?

```java
class Thought {
    public void message() {
        System.out.println("I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.");
    }
}

public class Advice extends Thought {
    @Override  // @Override annotation in Java 5 is optional but helpful.
    public void message() {
        System.out.println("Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.");
    }
}
```

- What is polymorphism?
  - Poly === Many, Morphism === Forms.
  - Many forms of 1 thing to achieve a result.
  - Polymorphism is a super class to overloading and overriding.
- Why use polymorphism?

```py
class Bird:
	def intro(self):
		print("There are many types of birds.")

	def flight(self):
		print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")

class sparrow(Bird):
	def flight(self):
		print("Sparrows can fly.")

class ostrich(Bird):
	def flight(self):
		print("Ostriches cannot fly.")

obj_bird = Bird()
obj_spr = sparrow()
obj_ost = ostrich()

obj_bird.intro()
obj_bird.flight()

obj_spr.intro()
obj_spr.flight()

obj_ost.intro()
obj_ost.flight()

"""
Output:

There are many types of birds.
Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.
There are many types of birds.
Sparrows can fly.
There are many types of birds.
Ostriches cannot fly.
"""

- What is boxing and unboxing?
  - Boxing is to convert a data type to an object.
  - Unboxing is the opposite, to convert an object to a data type.
- What's the difference between libraries and frameworks?
  - A library performs specific defined functions, like getting a piece of furniture that completes your home.
  - A framework provides a foundation where you input where you can, like selecting a house, but there's little options you can augment, but at the end of the day, it's up to the framework.
- What is a web service?
  - Another name for remote APIs.

- What's object oriented programming?
  - A way to describe what a thing is and what i can do.
  - I made a button and what it does is log out the user.
- What's an API?
  - Application program interface.
- What are interfaces?
  - A class with no implementation, just prototyping.
  - They provide no variables, but specific functions to be expected in an implementing class.
- Why use interfaces?
  - Because it means that you know 2 pieces will fit together wherever it's needed.
  - Don't have to worry about if a car or truck works on a road, because they both implement the interface of vehicle.
- Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems.
- Types of design patterns!
  - Creational!
    - Focused on instantiating an object or group of related objects.
  - Structural!
    - Concerned with object composition (how entities can use each other).
    - "How does one create a software component?"
  - Behavioral!
    - Concerned with assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    - Difference between this and structural is that not only do they specify the structure, but also outline patterns for communication between them.
    - "How does one run a behavior in software component?"
- Examples of creational design patterns.
  - Singleton!
    - There can only be 1 president at a time. The same president has to be brought to action when needed.
    - Strictly create a global instance of only 1 object with all methods.
- Examples of structural design patterns.
  - Bridge!
    - To have different themes for different pages, instead of creating multiple themed pages, this would apply a theme to the page.
    - This pushes implementation details from a hierarchy to another object with a separate hierarchy.
    - One interface would dictate webpages and getting a theme while the other would dictate the theme.
- Examples of behavioral design patterns.
  - State!
    - Think `ReactJS`.
    - If the user is logged in, update the UI to show relevant information to the user.

- Is it possible to break `JavaScript` code into several lines?
  - Yes through utilizing the backslash `\`.
- Which company developed `JavaScript`?
  - Netscape is the software company who developed `JavaScript`.
  - Brendan Eich in 1995 was the 1 who spearheaded the language.
- Differences between undeclared and undefined variables?
  - Undeclared variables are variables that don't exist yet.
  - Undefined variables are variables that don't have meaning yet.
- Write the code for adding new elements dynamically in `JavaScript`?
  - Inside the `.html` file, put a `<script src="/index.js" type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8">` with the code within.
  - `src` takes the source code and redistributes it into the `.html`.
  - Old browsers take in the type of `text/javascript` while newer ones also take in both the previous and `application/javascript`.
  - `charset` tells the browser how to interpret the characters (needed for foreign languages).
- The difference between `==` and `===`?
  - `==` checks value while `===` checks value and type.
  - For example `"24" == 24` would be true, but `"24" === 24` would be false because it is comparing a string and an integer.
- What's the use of lambda functions?
  - They are used as small anonymous functions.
  - They can take any parameters, but can only have 1 expression.
  - `lambda a : a + 10` takes in parameter `a` and adds 10 to it.

- Main differences between `Java` VS `JavaScript`.
  - `Java`.
    - Object oriented programming language.
      - Compiled (non-human readable code) then executed.
    - Mainly runs on the `Java` Virtual Machine (JVM).
  - `JavaScript`.
    - Object oriented scripting language.
      - Interpreted (not compiled).
    - Mainly runs on browser (More applications through `ReactJS` now).
- `JavaScript` Data Types?
  - Number.
  - String.
  - Boolean.
  - Object (When you don't know what it'll be during compile time).
  - Undefined.
- In `JavaScript`, what is the use of `isNaN` function?
  - `isNaN` returns true if argument is not a number, else false.
- How do you achieve negative infinity in `JavaScript`?
  - `%NEGATIVE-NUMBER%/0`
- What does `console.log(A || B)` do?
  - Same as a ternary, if A exists, print A, otherwise B.
- Difference between a method and function?
  - Methods are functions that are members of a class.
  - All methods are functions, but not all functions are methods.
- When to use `throw` VS `throw e`?
  - `throw` shows all information.
  - `throw e` resets the stack trace and shows core information.
  - Best practice to use `throw`.
- `DateTime`!
  - Remember when creating updates to new objects, it doesn't update, it creates new, so must assign everytime.
  - Instead of `clockerino.AddDays(1);`, do `clockerino = clockerino.AddDays(1);`
- What do you do if you encounter a `for` loop with augmenting a string?
  - Use `StringBuilder` if available, fast and less memory.
- Photography!
  - Shot for an organization's banquet, over 700+ photos.
- Gym!
  - Chest and triceps.

- More OOP understanding.
  - Classes are like blueprints.
    - These classes contain properties and methods.
      - Properties are such as `var type = fire`.
      - Methods are such as `flamethrower()`.

# May 1 2019

- Performed `Leetcode` questions.
- Object oriented programming revolves around 4 pillars.
  - Encapsulation.
    - Reduce complexity + increase resuability.
    - Charmander is hungry. You can `feed()` Charmander, but you can't change how hungry the Charmander is directly because that's private properties.
  - Abstraction.
    - Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes.
    - Charmander can use flamethrower, but you don't know how it does it, you just use it.
  - Inheritance.
    - Eliminate redundant code.
    - Charizard inherits Charmander's traits and moves, no need to recreate.
  - Polymorphism.
    - Refactor ugly switch/case statements.
    - Charizard can use `flamethrower()` like Charmander, but a different version called `fireBlast()`.

# April 18 2019

- Went over `ReactJS` technicalities.
- Instead of writing `.bind(this)` to every method that exists...

```js
constructor(props){
  super(props);
  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
}

handleClick(event){
  // Do stuff!
}
```

- We can instead use lexical scope.
  - Lexical scope is where a variable can be referenced within the scope that it is defined in.

```js
handleClick = (event) => {
  // Do stuff!
};
```

- With `Context` and `Hooks` available for `ReactJS` now, `ReduxJS` may be a thing in the past.
