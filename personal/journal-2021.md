- What's the difference between a dialog, modal, modeless, and window?
  - A window displays something.
  - A dialog is a window that asks for a user's response.
  - A modal is a dialog that requires a user's response and will close if the user decides to do other things.
  - A modeless is a dialog that requires a user's response, but remain open despite the user doing other things.
- Remembered a memory of playing with "Standard", "TRL", etc. on league and a few friends trying to go pro.

- In `bash`, `\\\` means what?
  - It means ` ` (space) since in scripts a space signifies a separate command, but sometimes we want to reference file names.

- In `bash`, how do you rename a file?
  - `mv %OLD-FILE-NAME% %NEW-FILE-NAME%

- In `React`, how should modals be paired with menus?
  - Modals should be at the same level as menus, even though they use each other, they're separate.
  - For example if I click on the settings icon, a menu opens, click on preferences, it should open the preferences and close the menu.
  - Mistake I was running into was that by setting the state of the menu to close when the preferences opens, it also closed the preferences which was not desired behavior.

- In `React`, when to use `useRef` vs `useState`?

- In your case start with 5% in the Roth TSP to get the match, then start working on maxing out a Roth IRA, then back to the TSP.
- Usually, people invest into their 401k up to the company match, and then their IRA to the max, and then back to the 401k to the max. The reason they do this is because the average 401k usually has higher fees than their IRA does, but leaving free money (the match) on the table would be stupid; hence the match, IRA, back to 401k.

Former optician here!

I highly recommend polycarbonate lenses (as opposed to a basic plastic lens- also known as CR) they are more durable and naturally scratch-resistant and have UV protection. When I worked as an optician, we could only add UV and scratch resistant coatings to a basic plastic lens.

High Index Lenses are typically better suited for prescriptions under - 2 but of course that is up to your personal preference. Some frames are not well-suited to high index lenses.

Anti-Reflective Coating helps reduce glare from nighttime driving, computer screens and helps reduce eye fatigue. If your eyes are sensitive to changes in light it is worth the cost.

Transitions/tinting is completely personal preference. Just be aware most transitions are NOT polarized the way normal sunglasses are.

If you have any other questions Iâ€™d be happy to help :)

- Finally finished my long task.

- In `React`, how should autosave be handled in terms of string inputs?
  
```js
// With autosave.
const [autoSave, setAutoSave] = useState("");
const [state, setState] = useStateWithCallback("");

const handleState = (event) => {
    setState(event, (update) => console.log("Do something with update", update));
}

const stateAutoSave = (event) => {
    setAutoSave(event);
    if (autoSave.length % 10 === 0 && autoSave.length !== 0) {
        handleState(event);
    }
}

onBlur={(event) => handleState(event.target.value)};
onChange={(event) => stateAutoSave(event.target.value)};

// Without autosave.
const [state, setState] = useStateWithCallback("");

const handleState = (event) => {
    console.log("Do something with state", state);
}

onBlur={handleState};
onChange={(event) => setState(event.target.value)};
```

- Time to teach `MongoDB`!
  - Went really well! Besides the `.git` mess we ended up in, mostly due to `NetBeans` IDE going into `IntelliJ` IDE.
- In `IntelliJ`, how does one organize the imports in alphabetical order?
  - `Ctrl + Alt + O`
  - This also adds required imports and removes unneeded imports.

- Finally back to work with the whole team.
- In `JavaScript`, how does one insert characters in a string at specific locations, I.E. a phone number?

```js
// Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6981793/12458952

var n = "1234567899";
console.log(n.replace(/(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/, "$1-$2-$3")); // Returns "123-456-7899".
```

- In `JavaScript`, what are some key things to note about the `JavaScript Date` object?

```js
// Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31732581/12458952

new Date("2011-09-24"); // "Year-Month-Day".
// => Fri Sep 23 2011 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - ONE DAY OFF.

new Date("09-24-2011");
// => Sat Sep 24 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - CORRECT DATE.

new Date("2011/09/24"); // Change from "-" to "/".
// => Sat Sep 24 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - CORRECT DATE.
```

- How does one `return` with a ternary?

```java

public static String createCharacterElement(Character character) {
    return character.getElement() != null ? "Element: " + character.getElement() : "Element: N/A";
}
```
