- In `JavaScript`, what are the differences between `Slice()`, `Splice()`, `Split())`, `Substr()`, and `substring()`?

```js
// string.slice(startIndex[, endIndex]) will not alter contents, used for strings and arrays.
let newArray = ["red", "orange", "green", "blue"]
newArray.slice(0, 1) // Returns ["red"].
newArray.slice(0, 3) // Returns ["red", "orange", "green"].
newArray.slice(1) // Returns ["orange", "green", "blue"].
newArray.slice(-1) // Returns ["blue"].

// array.splice(startIndex[, deleteCount[, item1[, item2[, ...]]]]) will alter contents, used for arrays.
let newArray = ["red", "orange", "green", "blue"]
newArray.splice(0, 1) // Returns ["red"], newArray is now ["orange", "green", "blue"].
newArray.splice(1) // Returns ["orange", "green", "blue"], newArray is now ["red"].
newArray.splice(4, 0, "pink") // Returns [], newArray is now ["red", "orange", "green", "blue", "pink"].
newArray.splice(2, 1, "pink") // Returns ["green"], newArray is now ["red", "orange", "pink", "blue"].

// string.split([separator[, limit]]) will not alter contents, used for strings.
let newString = "we are learning about the javascript method split"
newString.split() // Returns ["we are learning about the javascript method split"].
newString.split("") // Returns ["w", "e", " ", "a", ...etc.].
newString.split(" ") // Returns ["we", "are", "learning", "about", "the", "javascript", "method", "split"].
newString.split(“ “, 3) // Returns ["we", "are", "learning"].

// string.substr(startIndex[, length]) will not alter contents, used for strings.
const str = 'Mozilla';
newString.substr(1, 2); // Returns "oz".
newString.substr(2); // Returns "zilla".

// string.substring(startIndex[, endIndex]) will not alter contents, used for strings.
const str = 'Mozilla';
newString.substring(1, 3); // Returns "oz".
newString.substring(2); // Returns "zilla".
```

- What does the `[]` mean in example functions such as `string.substring(startIndex[, endIndex])`?
  - The `[]` denotes "optional".

 * @param {{myNumber: Number, myString: String, myArray: Array}[]} myObjects
 */

- In `React`, how does one provide a `useState` with a callback?
  - `useState` setter doesn't provide a callback after state update is done like `setState` does in `React` class components.
  - In order to replicate the same behavior, you can make use of the a similar pattern like `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method in `React` class components with `useEffect` using Hooks.
  - Can use this and export the function to be used in your application via `import { useStateWithCallback } from "wherever/you/put/this";`

```js
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

export const useStateWithCallback = (initialState) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  // "cb" means "callback".
  const cbRef = useRef(null);

  const setStateCallback = (state, cb) => {
    cbRef.current = cb;
    setState(state);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    // "cb.current" is null on initial render, we only want updates.
    if (cbRef.current) {
      cbRef.current(state);
      cbRef.current = null;
    }
  }, [state]);

  return [state, setStateCallback];
}
```

- In `Java`, when declaring variables, why is `String` capitalized and `int` isn't in certain cases?
- In `Java`, `String` is unique because it's an object with attributes such as length.
- Ints are just dumb because they hold a number. (But can't you get the length of that too?)

- In `React`, why would one use `<Fragment` over `<div>` for containing inner elements?
  - The problem with `<div>` is that you don't always want a wrapper element..
    - Wrapper elements have a meaning and usually you need additional styles for that meaning to be removed.
  - `<Fragment>` is just syntactic sugar that is not rendered.
  - It’s a tiny bit faster and has less memory usage (no need to create an extra DOM node).
- Kill port that's in use?

- What defines art?
  - Display.
    - To put your art in the open.
  - Intention.
    - To create something meaningful for the purpose of aesthetic.
  - Reception.
    - Someone else has their own interpretation.
- When pushing builds to `Nexus`, instead of specifying a `.npmignore`, best to use the `files` attribute to specify which files are wanted in the final build.

```js
"files": [
  "dist/",
  "%OTHER-FILE%"
]
```

- To find out what files `npm` will publish into the tarball without actually publishing.
  - `npm pack && tar -xvzf *.tgz && rm -rf package *.tgz`
- If a directory is present, remove it, else do nothing. (No error messages)
  - `rm -rf %DIRECTORY%`
- How does one release a software candidate for `Nexus` through `Jenkins`?

  - Copy that scoped directory to the offline computer.
    - Make sure that the file has a `manifest.json`.
  - On the offline computer now, open up `Google Chrome`.
  - Put in the URL `chrome://extensions`.

- In `React`, how does one add to an array using `React Hooks`?
  - `searches.push(query)`?
    - Doesn't ever get "set" with the `setSearches` hook.
  - `setSearches(searches.push(query))`?
    - `.push` returns the length of the array instead of the array itself.
  - `setSearches(searches.concat(query))?
    - Works great since `.concat` creates a new array than an old one.
  - `setSearches([query].concat(searches))`
    - Works great if needing to add to the front of the data structure.
  - `setSearches(searches => searches.concat(query))`
    - Even better since there's a wrapper function.
  - `setSearches(searches => [...searches, query])`
    - Ideal solution.
  - `setSearches(searches => [query, ...searches])`
    - Ideal solution if needing to add to the front of the data structure.
- What's a wrapper function's purpose?
  - To call another function (callback).
  - Think of it as an alarm clock, will call the proper function at the right time.
  - Can not mess a function up (usually), so I can't trust myself to wake myself up, but a wrapper function will be trustworthy to wake me up (alarm clock).
- How does one create a `package.json` properly?
  - `npm init`
  - Will prompt for each field that needs input.

- In `Material UI`, what is the difference between styled components `props` and `CSS` stylesheets?
  - Styled components `props` pros.
    - No global selectors, no worries about overriding selectors.
    - Consistency.
    - `Sass` syntax out of the box.
    - Themes, making a parent's style accessible to children.
    - Easy to use props with different definitions such as `small`, `medium`, and `large` rather than hard-coding each.
  - Styled components `props` cons.
    - Learning curve.
    - Integration with legacy `CSS`.
    - Potentially a "fad".
    - Performance.
  - `CSS` stylesheets pros.
    - Unopinionated and universal, the same old.
    - Caching and performance.
    - Quickly iterate a new design by replacing the respective stylesheet with a new one.
    - Ease of use.
    - Frameworks which provide tutorials and foundation.
  - `CSS stylesheets cons.
    - Readability.
    - Legacy CSS can live forever and may be difficult to deal with in the future.
    - Global scope and specificity.
    - No true dynamic styling.
    - Maintaining consistency.
- When to use "&" versus "and"?
  - Only use "&" when comparing proper nouns or things that are a "pair".
    - "Research & Design", "Web & Mobile", "AT&T".
  - Otherwise "and" is the default case.
    - "Family and friends", "small, medium, and large".
- In `React`, how is `clsx` used?
  - `clsx` is generally used to conditionally apply a given `className`.

```js
import clsx from "clsx";

const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);
const classes = useStyles();

const handleDrawerOpen = () => {
  setOpen(true);
};

const handleDrawerClose = () => {
  setOpen(false);
};

<Drawer
  variant="permanent"
  classes={{
    // Always show drawer, unless open changes to false, then close the drawer.
    paper: clsx(classes.drawerPaper, !open && classes.drawerPaperClose),
  }}
  open={open}

  <div className={classes.toolbarIcon}>
    <IconButton onClick={handleDrawerClose}>
      <ChevronLeftIcon />
    </IconButton>

# August 4 2020

- What does the `static` keyword do?
  - Static methods are called directly on the class without creating an instance/object of the class.
- Why would someone want to use the `static` keyword?
  - "Does it make sense to call this method, even if no object has been constructed yet?"
    - If so, it should definitely be static.
  - An example would be if there was a car class with a `static` method called `convertMpgToKpl()` which could be used without creating a car, it could be done outside of it.
  - Usually utility classes will encompass these `static` methods due to their scope and flexibility for all other files to use.
- How can the size of files and directories in `Linux` be seen within the terminal?

```sh
# ls = files
# du = directories

ls -l $FILENAME% # Displays size of the specified file.
ls -l *          # Displays size of all the files in the current directory.
ls -al *         # Displays size of all the files including hidden files in the current directory.
ls -al dir/      # Displays size of all the files including hidden files in the 'dir' directory.

du -sh %DIRECTORY-NAME%  # Gives you the summarized (-s) size of the directory in human readable (-h) format.
du -bsh *                # Gives you the apparent (-b) summarized (-s) size of all the files and directories in the current directory in human readable (-h) format.
```

- What is the standard way to call `static` methods?

```js
// Be mindful of inheritance syntax.

class Super {
  static whoami() {
    return "Super";
  }
  lognameA() {
    console.log(Super.whoami());
  }
  lognameB() {
    console.log(this.constructor.whoami());
  }
}

class Sub extends Super {
  static whoami() {
    return "Sub";
  }
}

new Sub().lognameA();
// "Super".

new Sub().lognameB();
// "Sub".
```

- In `CSS`, what is `flex-grow`?
  - This property specifies how much of the remaining space in the flex container should be assigned to the item.
- In `CSS`, what is `CSS Baseline`?
  - A collection of HTML element and attribute style-normalizations, a global reset.
- In `CSS`, what is `aria-label`?
  - The `aria-label` attribute is used to define a string that labels the current element.
  - Use it in cases where a text label is not visible on the screen.
  - If there is visible text labeling the element, use `aria-labelled` by instead.
- In `CSS`, what is `ARIA`?
  - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.
- In `Material-UI`, what's the purpose of having both `AppBar` and `Toolbar`?
  - Think of `AppBar` as the header and `Toolbar` of the amount of horizontal bars within the header.

# August 3 2020

- In `JavaScript`, how does the `splice()` function work?
  - Can be used to delete, add, or replace with the data structure being an array.
  - To delete, `.splice(index, number of elements to delete)`
  - To add, `.splice(index, number of elements to delete, thing to be added in, another thing, etc.)`
  - To replace, `.splice(index, number of elements, thing to replace)`

```js
// Delete.
let scores = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let deletedScores = scores.splice(0, 3);
console.log(scores); //  [4, 5]
console.log(deletedScores); // [1, 2, 3]

// Add.
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
colors.splice(2, 0, "purple");
console.log(colors); // ["red", "green", "purple", "blue"]

// Replace.
let languages = ["C", "C++", "Java", "JavaScript"];
languages.splice(2, 1, "C#", "Swift", "Go");
console.log(languages); // ["C", "Python", "C#", "Swift", "Go", "JavaScript"]
```

- In `Javascript`, how does one determine the variable is `undefined` or `null` properly?

```js
// Since "null == undefined" already, just do this.
if (variable == null) {

- In `JavaScript`, how does one sort array of objects by property value?

```js
var champions = [
  { name: "Jarvan IV", group: "Demacia", stars: 1 },
  { name: "Kayn", group: "Edgelord", stars: 3 },
  { name: "Zac", group: "Slime", stars: 5 },
];

function compare(a, b) {
  if (a.stars < b.stars) {
    return -1;
  }
  if (a.stars > b.stars) {
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

champions.sort(compare);

// OR!

champions.sort((a, b) => (a.stars > b.stars ? 1 : b.stars > a.stars ? -1 : 0));

// OR!

champions.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.stars < b.stars) {
    return -1;
  }
  if (a.stars > b.stars) {
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
});
```

- In `JavaScript`, how does one achieve the first or last item in an array?

```js
let champions = ["Ezreal", "Vayne", "Zac"];

console.log(champions[0]);
// "Ezreal".

console.log(champions[champions.length - 1]);
// "Zac".

- What is `CRUD`?
  - Create, read, update, and delete.
- What is the purpose for the `CRUD` functions of create, read, update, and delete?

```js
const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

const found = array1.find((element) => element > 10);

console.log(found);
// expected output: 12
```

- In `JavaScript`, what are the main differences between `.find()` and `.some()`.
  - `.find()` returns a value and used to look for one specific value.
    - "Is there a dog here named "Bolt"?"

// If you want to avoid inherited properties:

for (var key in obj) {
  if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;
  console.log(key, obj[key]);
}

// For the new ECMAScript 5th Edition:
Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (key) {
  console.log(key, obj[key]);
});

];

function add(arr, name) {
  const { length } = arr;
  const id = length + 1;
  // If the array has a username equivalent to the parameter given username.
  const found = arr.some((el) => el.username === name);
  // If the username is unique, push the new object username.
  if (!found) arr.push({ id, username: name });
  return arr;
}

console.log(add(arr, "ted"));

- What does `React Hooks` and `Context API` help make?
  - A `Flux/Redux` pattern.
- What is the `useEffect` hook for?
  - It'll be similar to previous `React` lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

- Another example of `React Context` is in the `react/context/` folder.
- When would you use class components over functional components?
  - It's gotten to the point where the only use is for access lifecycle methods that are specific to class components, otherwise can stick to functional.

# June 28 2020

- What is `React Context`?
  - Global state management for an application.
  - Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- Why use `React Context`?
  - Imagine passing down `props` which in itself isn't so bad across 2 components.
  - If it's across multiple components with multiple nested structures, it becomes difficult to manage.
- How does one start with `React Context`?
  - Create the context, `React.createContext()`
  - Provide a context value, `<UserProvider value={...something}>`
  - Consume the context value, `<UserConsumer>...</UserConsumer>`

```js
// userContext.js

import React from 'react';

const UserContext = React.createContext();

const UserProvider = UserContext.Provider;
const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer;

export { UserProvider, UserConsumer };

export default UserContext;

// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import AAAComponent from './components/AAAComponent';
import { UserProvider } from './components/userContext';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const user = {firstName: 'AC', lastName: 'De Leon'}
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <UserProvider value={...user}>
          <AAAComponent/>
        </UserProvider>
      </div>
    )
  }
};

export default App

// AAAComponent.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import BBBComponent from './components/BBBComponent';

class AAAComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <BBBComponent/>
      </div>
    )
  }
};

// BBBComponent.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import AAAComponent from './AAAComponent';
import UserContext from './userContext';

class BBBComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <UserContext.Consumer>
        {user => (
          <p>User: {user.firstName} {user.lastName}</p>
        )}
      </UserContext.Consumer>
    )
  }
}

BBBComponent.contextType = UserContext;

export default BBBComponent

- Working with `SonarLint` in `JavaScript`.
  - MAJOR - S3404: Remove this "!==" check; it will always be true. Did you mean to use "!="?
    - `"3" != 3` will return false because `JavaScript` will perform type coercion and compare values.
    - `"3" !== 3` will return true because since they are different types, despite the value, it will never be equal.
- What is type coercion in `JavaScript`?
  - When the operands of an operator are different types, one of them will be converted to an "equivalent" value of the other operand's type.
  - `boolean == integer` will cause the boolean to be converted to an integer.
  - `false` becomes `0` and `true` becomes `1`.

- How does one make nested attributes within a class?

```java
// Notice that it's a class within a class.

public class PositionObject {
  private int id;
  private Position position;

  public PositionObject (int id, Position position) {
      this.id = id;
      this.position = position;
  }

  class Position {
    Float lat;
    Float lon;

    Position (Float lat, Float lon) {
      this.lat = lat
      this.lon = lon
    }
  }
}

// and to call the class.

PositionObject positionObject = new PositionObject(1, new Position(2f, 3f));
```

- What are the state and life cycle changes to `React`?
  - The need for class components has significantly lowered down since functional can just do the same with less code.
  - Instead of defining initial state in a constructor, we can use `React Hooks`, specifically `useState`.
  - Instead of `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`, `useEffect`, which is part of `React Hooks`, can manage changes made to the state.
- How does one untrack files already added to `Git` when adding the `.gitignore` afterwards?
  - Commit all changes, including `.gitignore`.
  - `git rm -r --cached .`
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "[-] .gitignore fix"`
  - Done!

- In `React`, what does `useEffect` hook do?
  - Replaces `componentDidMount` and `ComponentDidUpdate`.
  - The second argument of `useEffect` will go over an array of values the effect depends on.
    - Passing an empty array, the `useEffect` will only run on first render.
- How does one stash in the terminal for `Git`?
  - `git stash` or `git stash push`
- How do you apply the stash in the terminal for `Git`?
  - `git stash apply`
- What if you have multiple stashes, how do you choose which one to apply?
  - `git stash apply "stash@{n}"` (Quotations may or may not be used depending on the shell.)
- What is a framework?
  - A framework (or a library) is pre-written code that makes it easier to build the same kind of thing repeatedly.
- What is front-end?
  - Anything that has to do with the UI/UX software development.
  - Front-end is not always client-side, but client-side is always front-end.
- What is a front-end framework?
  - This term causes confusion as most people really mean is client-side rendering framework.
  - Generally (in the 2020 context, future readers of this journal), a front-end framework is a code library (aka pre-written) to make client-side rendering easier and faster.
  - Examples include:
    - React.
    - Vue.
    - Angular.
- What is back-end?
  - Anything that has to do with nothing of the UI/UX sort.
- What is a back-end framework?
  - They're usually "general purpose web frameworks".
  - Can do back-end and front-end duties.
  - Examples include:
    - Rails.
    - Django.
    - Laravel.
    - ExpressJS.

- Why do bash script history persist even after shutdown of `Linux` in virtual machine?

```bash
# Due to the `~/.bashrc` having this...

# Make Bash append rather than overwrite the history on disk:

PROMPT-COMMAND='history -a'
# Don't put duplicate lines in the history.

- TSP SAVINGS + ROTH DED = TSP BASIC + TSP MATCHING.
- What is a server?
  - A computer that is on the internet.
- What is the internet?
  - A collection of many servers.
- What is a client?
  - The software that runs on the user's computer that communicates with the server.
- What are client-side operations?
  - Things that can be done on the user's side without much communication.
  - It's like building up something then sending it to the server in a nice package so it's only 1 call.
- What are server-side operations?
  - Things that require heavy amount of resources and space that the server performs.
  - Also handles security issues.
    - I can't just look at someone's profile if I'm not friend's with them, so the server places security.
- What is rendering?
  - In this context, a combination of data from the server with the client to be displayed.
- Key thing is to download aesthetics once, data endlessly.

  - WebSockets run from browsers connecting to application server over a protocol similar to HTTP that runs over TCP/IP.
    - Primarily for web apps that require a permanent connection to its server.
  - Sockets run over TCP/IP, but they are not restricted to browsers or HTTP protocol.
    - Could be used to implement any kind of communication.

# February 26 2020

- What is destructing? (Examples in `ReactJS`)

```js
// Imagine you have a person object with the following properties.
const person = {
  firstName: "Lindsay",
  lastName: "Criswell",
  city: "NYC",
};

// To obtain each property individually.
console.log(person.firstName);
console.log(person.lastName);
console.log(person.city);

// Destructuring lets us streamline this code.
const { firstName, lastName, city } = person;

// Which is equivalent to.
const firstName = person.firstName;
const lastName = person.lastName;
const city = person.city;

// So now we can access the properties without the `person` prefix.
console.log(firstName); // Lindsay
console.log(lastName); // Criswell
console.log(city); // NYC

// First level with props.
const Attraction = (props) => {
  return (
    <div auth={props.auth} key={props.attraction.id}>
      <Link
        auth={props.auth.token}
        to={`/attractions/${props.attraction.url-name}`}
        key={props.attraction.id}
      >
        <img alt={props.attraction.name} src={props.attraction.image-url} />
        <h1>{props.attraction.name}</h1>
      </Link>
      <StarRatings rating={props.attraction.average-rating} />
    </div>
  );
};

// Second level without props.
const Attraction = ({ auth, attraction }) => {
  return (
    <div auth={auth} key={attraction.id}>
      <Link
        token={auth.token}
        to={`/attractions/${attraction.url-name}`}
        key={attraction.id}
      >
        <img alt={attraction.name} src={attraction.image-url} />
        <h1>{attraction.name}</h1>
      </Link>
      <StarRatings rating={attraction.average-rating} />
    </div>
  );
};

// Third level destructuring the destruction.
const Attraction = ({
  // `auth` and `auth: { token }` gives access to both the whole `auth` object and its `token`.
  // So if you need to pass down more than just the `token`, this is what is needed.
  auth,
  auth: { token },
  attraction: { id, url-name, name, image-url, average-rating },
}) => {
  return (
    <div auth={auth} key={id}>
      <Link token={token} to={`/attractions/${url-name}`} key={id}>
        <img alt={name} src={image-url} />
        <h1>{name}</h1>
      </Link>
      <StarRatings rating={average-rating} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- What does `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` do?

```js
// Maps an action to the data and returns the results.
map([🌽, 🐮, 🐔], cook) => [🍿, 🍔, 🍳]

// Filters the data with a condition.
filter([🍿, 🍔, 🍳], isVegetarian) => [🍿, 🍳]

// Reduces the data to an accumulated result.
reduce([🍿, 🍳], eat) => 💩
```

- What is the difference between `React Hooks` and `React Context API`?
  - `React Hooks` allows you to use local state inside of function components.

- Embedding VS Referencing in database design?
  - Embedded should be used when:
    - Child data "belongs" to parent data (1-to-1).
    - Sub-documents are small in size.
    - Hierarchical structures.
  - Referencing should be used when:
    - Many-to-many relationships.
    - Sub-documents that continuously increase in size.
    - Large (16MB) sub-document information.
  - Cautions with embedding!
    - With properties that grow, unnecessary data could be sent with each query.
      - When scrolling on social media, we just want 10 posts at a time, not all the posts.
    - Many-to-many relationships can get messy.
  - Cautions with references!
    - References requires queries for each individual document for each individual document: O(n2)
    - If only using references, relational database may be better.
  - How does one pick what to utilize?
    - Depends on how much you use a specific thing.
    - If it's static and/or used a lot, embedded is best.
    - If it's dynamic and/or used less, references is best.

```
// Example 1.

// Embedded.
{
  blog: "This is a blog."
  posts: [
    {
      title: "Hello!",
      content: "Lorum ipsum.",
      comments: [{/*...*/}]
    },
    {
      title: "Hello!",
      content: "Lorum ipsum.",
      comments: [{/*...*/}]
    },
  ]
}

// Referenced.
{
  blog: "This is a blog."
  posts: [ "someid1", "someid2" ]
}

posts: [
  {
    id: "someid1"
    title: "Hello!",
    content: "Lorum ipsum.",
    comments: [{/*...*/}]
  },
  {
    id: "someid2"
    title: "Hello!",
    content: "Lorum ipsum.",
    comments: [{/*...*/}]
  },
]

// Example 2.

// Embedded.
// We don't always need to call the `orderHistory`.
{
  username: "ac",
  address: {
    line1: "123 Main St.",
    line2: null,
    city: "Corona",
    state: "CO",
    zip: 12345
  }
  cart: {
    items: [ { id: "someid" , id: "someid", etc. }]
    status: "Active"
  },
  orderHistory: [
    {
      items: [ { id: "someid" , id: "someid", etc. }],
      status: "Paid"
    },
    {
      items: [ { id: "someid" , id: "someid", etc. }],
      status: "Paid"
    },
  ]
}

// Referenced.
// Best to have the `cart` right there instead of searching by ID to see what's inside.
{
  username: "ac",
  address: {
    line1: "123 Main St.",
    line2: null,
    city: "Corona",
    state: "CO",
    zip: 12345
  }
  cart: { id: "someid" },
  orderHistory: [
    { id: "someid" },
    { id: "someid" },
    { etc. }
  ]
}

// Both!
// Best of both worlds.

- What is the relationship of `Spectron` to `WebdriverIO` and `Selenium WebDriver`?
  - `Selenium WebDriver` allows developers to write tests that control a web browser so they can test apps from a user's perspective.
  - `WebdriverIO` wraps the `Selenium WebDriver` with a pleasant `JavaScript` API and makes it easy to use from within `Node.js` or an `Electron` application in our case.
  - `Spectron` allows access to `WebdriverIO` with a environment custom-tailored functionality for `Electron` applications.
- What is the primary way to use `Spectron`?
  - Create an `Application` instance.
  - This object includes a number of child objects that allow us to access different parts of the application.
- What are the different parts of `Spectron`?
  - `client`
    - The underlying `WebdriverIO` instance.
  - `electron`
    - `Electron`'s renderer process API.
  - `browserWindow`
    - The currently focused browser window.
  - `webContents`
    - `Electron`'s WebContents API.
  - `mainProcess`
    - Node's process object in the main process.
  - `rendererProcess`
    - Node's process object in the renderer process.
- Is it better to have the front-end and back-end in the same repo or separate repos.
  - Depends.
  - Usually separate repos is desirable due to modularization and scalability.
  - Reasons for same repos is for the engineers to understand the product as a whole.
- How does a standard `Electron` test file look like?

```js
const Application = require("spectron").Application; // `Spectron`'s application driver.
const assert = require("assert"); // `Node.js`'s built in assertion library.
const electronPath = require("electron"); // Locally installed development version of `Electron`.
const path = require("path"); // `Node.js`'s helper utility for working with file paths.

const app = new Application({
  path: electronPath,
  args: [path.join(__dirname, "..")], // Points to root directory of application as a starting point.
});

describe("Application launch", function() {
  this.timeout(10000); // `Mocha`'s default timeout because launching can take a while.

  beforeEach(() => {
    return app.start(); // Starts application before each test.
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    if (app && app.isRunning()) {
      return app.stop(); // Stops the application after each test.
    }
  });

  it("should have 1 window", function() {
    const count = await app.client.getWindowCount();
    return assert.equal(count, 1);
  })
});
```

  - Multiple VMS.
- What is a traditional containerization?
  - Hardware (Server).
  - Operating System.
  - Containers.
- What are the differences between VMs VS containers?
  - VMs are not as flexible when utilizing resources on the hardware where containers are flexible and use what it needs, not fixed.
- Why use `Docker`?
  - Makes it easy to develop and deploy apps inside neat containers.
- Instead of controlling 1 container at a time, `Docker Compose` is a tool to use to affect multiple containers at once.
