Notes:

- What’s your position and how long have you been in the position?
  - I’m a software engineer, and I started in mid-September. I do mostly front-end web / API work.
- Did you choose to work on the OWL website? (From my understanding, Brandon told me you both work on OWL ~)
  - I didn’t choose to be on the OWL team – I applied to Overwatch web team, and it’s divided into `playoverwatch` and `overwatchleague`. 
  - During the interview process, they asked if I had an interest in eSports and I said yes, so I think that’s how I ended up on the `overwatchleague` side of the team. 
  - I super happy with how it turned out – I love Overwatch as a game, and I love esports in general, so it’s really exciting to be part of the Overwatch League, especially in these early seasons.
- What was your journey getting there, as in how did you know Blizzard was for you?
  - I actually tried out a different internship each summer. I tried research in Boston, a startup in NYC, and a bank in SF before I applied to Blizzard.
  - After those internships, I realized I really wanted to work somewhere where I love the product (Overwatch and eSports!) and love the people (Blizzard people are really nice and motivated, as you probably picked up from talking to the other people!).
  - As a bonus, Blizzard is in SoCal which is probably the nicest places I’ve lived so far. 
  - What helped me stand out was probably my technical experience and passion for Overwatch. As I mentioned, I did a lot of internships. But I also did personal projects, basically every semester I would pick a framework I didn’t know (React, Meteor, Knockout, Angular, etc.) and partner up with a different friend to make a small app.
  - That helped me get a taste of a lot of different web development technologies, which in turn helps you know what you like/dislike about particular frameworks. I still have a lot to learn, but I think the personal projects helped show that I was willing to put in the effort to learn on my own. But it’s not just enough to like coding - the passion for Overwatch thing is also important.
  - Blizzard wants to hire people who are really into the company or the games.
  - So definitely try to get that across (the cover letter is a great place for that).
