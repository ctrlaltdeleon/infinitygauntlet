<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to traffic school! We thank you for selecting our course to 
fulfill your traffic school requirement, and we hope that you have a great 
time completing our entertaining, easy-to-read program!</p>

<h3>Course Objectives</h3>

<h4>Reduce Traffic Collisions</h4>

<p>Motor vehicle travel is the primary means of transportation in the 
United States, providing an unprecedented degree of mobility. Yet, driving 
a motor vehicle is the single most dangerous thing that most people do 
every day.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that 
motor vehicle crashes are one of the leading cause of death in the 
United States, and more than 2.5 million drivers and passengers were 
treated in emergency departments as a result of being injured in motor 
vehicle crashes in 2015. The economic impact is also notable: in a 
one-year period, the cost of medical care and productivity losses 
associated with occupant injuries and deaths from motor vehicle traffic 
crashes exceeded $75 billion.</p>

<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports 
that, in 2018, 36,560 people were killed in the estimated 6.7 million 
police-reported motor vehicle traffic crashes in the United States; 
2,710,000 people were injured. That's nearly 7,500 people injured 
<em>each day</em>! Worse still, an average of over four lives were 
lost <em>every hour</em> in traffic crashes—men, women, and 
children…people we knew but will never get to see again.</p>

<p>This course will highlight defensive driving strategies and techniques 
that, if used on the road, can help you and your passengers to avoid 
becoming a part of this tragedy.</p>

<h4>Reduce Traffic Law Violations</h4>

<p>The California Vehicle Code (CVC) has been developed because rules 
and procedures are necessary to define and regulate the interactions 
of the large population of drivers that we have on our highways. 
Without traffic laws, we would face even more chaos on the road than 
we already do! As a driver, you are not expected to know every section 
of the vehicle code by heart, but you should know the basics that will 
allow you to interact safely with other users of the roadway on a 
daily basis. This course will refresh your memory about important and 
frequently used traffic laws that you studied when learning to drive. 
By observing those regulations at all times you'll not only be a safer 
driver, but you'll avoid another expensive citation!</p>

<h4>Reemphasize that Driving Is a Serious Responsibility</h4>

<p>You don't operate your vehicle in a vacuum. A driver is not a lone 
individual whose decisions have no impact on others. Instead, drivers 
are members of a larger traffic community. Each driver, therefore, is 
responsible for helping to keep all of the other users of the roadway 
safe. After all, making a "wrong" decision while driving can be deadly!</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Loaded_Weapon.jpg" alt="Loaded Weapon">
</div>

<p>For those who choose to travel in or around automobiles, there must 
be the understanding that a motor vehicle can be extremely dangerous. 
Just as an experienced chef is expected to have full control over his 
knives, or a police officer well versed in the use of her sidearm, 
licensed drivers need to be focused and under control behind the wheel. 
For, much as an inattentive chef may make an unfortunate slice or a 
careless officer may misfire, <em>drivers are dealing with a potential 
weapon that becomes even more dangerous when carelessly or improperly 
operated.</em></p>

<p>Because of the mass and power of motor vehicles, it is easy to see 
how the automobile has grown to be one of the leading causes of carnage 
and death in the United States. In fact, the number of Americans killed 
in auto collisions is astoundingly higher than the number of those who 
have died in all of the wars our country has ever fought. The automobile, 
sadly, is the unintended weapon of choice in the United States—and 
the death toll continues to rise. Do what you can to make the roads 
safer by practicing the basics and following your common sense while 
driving!</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Even at "low" speeds, a vehicle can be 
dangerous. Most fatal collisions occur on local streets at speeds less 
than 40 mph!</p>

<h2>Reasons for Traffic Laws and <br>
Recent Changes to Them</h2>

<h3>Reasons for Traffic Laws</h3>

<p>Traffic laws as we know them today have matured over the 100-some 
years since people began driving automobiles—sometimes by trial 
and error, sometimes as a result of extensive scientific investigation. 
Today, legislators and traffic engineers have crafted rules for just 
about every (general) situation that a driver might face on the roadway, 
and an abundance of scientific studies have been conducted to determine 
how fairly and effectively these regulations actually order the driving 
environment. Yet, as you'll see below, traffic laws are continuing to 
evolve. So…why have so many people invested so much time and 
energy into developing, testing, and revising so many regulations?</p>

<p>It may be hard to believe sometimes—like when a law 
enforcement officer has just handed you a citation!—but traffic 
laws are there to <em>help</em> you. For a large population of drivers 
to share the highways and thoroughfares safely and capably, governments 
have been forced to create a system of rules and regulations by which we 
can all get along and use the roads effectively and efficiently. In the 
end, traffic laws promote safety, common understanding, and the smooth 
flow of traffic.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Cal_Vehicle_Code.jpg" alt="California Vehicle Code">
<div class="caption">Traffic laws promote safety, <br>
common understanding, and <br>
the smooth flow of traffic.</div>
</div>

<h4>Safety</h4>

<p>The California Vehicle Code (CVC) contains the laws governing the 
driver licensing process, the expiration and renewal of a driver license, 
and the suspension and revocation of a driver license. It specifies what 
types of vehicles may be driven and towed. It specifies what types of 
hazardous cargo may be transported, by whom, and under what conditions. 
It sets forth the rules for the ownership, sale, and maintenance of 
vehicles and trailers in the state of California. And it provides laws 
governing the safe operation of motor vehicles.</p>

<p>It does all of these things because motor vehicles can be extremely 
dangerous. Especially in vehicle-centric California, automobiles have 
become omnipresent in our lives; and they have done much to enhance our 
mobility and improve our everyday existence. Still, they are ultimately 
pieces of heavy machinery—massive assemblies of shiny glass, cold 
metal, and molded plastic—that should command our consideration 
and our respect. When operated in a careless or improper manner, a 
motor vehicle can be a rolling instrument of death that weighs in at 
over 3,000 pounds and contains flammable liquids. It is traffic laws 
that specify the "proper manner of operation" and the legal penalties 
for drivers who fail to comply with legal requirements.</p>

<p>This sounds nasty and oppressive when you're the one getting the 
ticket, but that's entirely the wrong attitude to have! Precisely 
because motor vehicles are capable of such carnage and destruction, 
don't you <em>want</em> rules and regulations for their safe operation? 
Isn't it better to have laws that will protect you, your passengers, and 
your fellow drivers (as well as pedestrians and others in the driving 
environment) while you're out on the road? It is with the goal of 
providing this protection—this <em>public safety</em>—that 
traffic laws have been enacted.</p>

<div class="caption">Humans aren't mind readers <br>
(at least, not <em>most</em> of us). <br>
Fortunately, traffic laws <br>
help to establish a common <br>
understanding among drivers.</div>
</div>

<h4>Common Understanding</h4>

<p>Effective communication between users of the roadway is one of the 
primary tenets of defensive driving. Traffic laws help to establish 
a vocabulary that allows this information exchange to take place 
effectively and efficiently. For instance, when you see a flashing 
light at the corner of another vehicle, you can guess that the driver 
is probably intending to turn (or, less likely, has activated the 
emergency flashers). This instant recognition is possible because 
traffic laws have established the requirements for vehicles' signal 
lights and for their use in indicating turns.</p>

<p>The instant recognition enabled by traffic regulations also helps 
drivers to interpret traffic control devices in the driving environment. 
For instance, drivers who spot an octagonal (eight-sided) red sign know 
immediately that they must come to a stop. The <a target="_blank" href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/"><em>Manual on Uniform Traffic Control 
Devices</em></a> (<em>MUTCD</em>) defines the standards used by road 
managers nationwide to install and maintain traffic control devices 
on all public streets, highways, bikeways, and private roads open to 
public traffic. The <em>MUTCD</em> is published by the Federal Highway 
Administration and is updated periodically to accommodate the nation's 
changing transportation needs and to address new safety technologies, 
traffic control tools, and traffic management techniques; states must 
adopt as their legal standards within two years the guidelines in each 
new edition of the manual.</p>

<p>The common understanding promoted by traffic laws also establishes 
shared expectations about how other drivers will react to a given 
situation. For instance, when approaching the stop sign mentioned 
above, you can reasonably expect that others drivers will come to a 
complete stop—just as you would. Or, you might expect that a 
vehicle in a lane marked with an arrow painted on the pavement will 
proceed in the direction that the arrow is pointing. (Of course, as a 
defensive driver, you must remember that your reasonable expectation 
that another driver will act in a certain way does <em>not</em> mean 
that he or she always will!)</p>

<h4>Keeping Order and Movement in Traffic</h4>

<p>Even at its best, the driving environment can be chaotic. After all, 
there's a <em>lot</em> going on out there! Despite all of this hubbub, 
we all really just want to get where we're going as quickly as possible; 
and, like the reluctant hero in an old Western, we don't want any 
trouble. Unfortunately, we tend to respond instinctively to uncertainty 
and confusion with a simple fight-or-flight reaction. On a crowded 
roadway, however, neither being scared into paralysis nor angrily 
lashing out at others will improve our chances of arriving at our 
destination in a safe and timely manner.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Driving_Chaos.jpg" alt="Driving Chaos">
<div class="caption">Drivers must proceed slowly and carefully when danger <br>
can come from any direction. Traffic laws keep order <br>
and movement in traffic.</div>
</div>

<p>Traffic laws promote order in the driving environment by establishing 
rules by which all users of the roadway are expected to operate. The 
regularity and predictability exhibited by an ordered environment 
allow drivers to relinquish a certain amount of caution—or, more 
precisely, to focus their attention and caution on those objects and 
events that are the true hazards in the more ordered environment.</p>

<p>By establishing and maintaining order, traffic laws encourage the free 
flow of traffic. Imagine the care that must be taken to operate a vehicle 
safely when <em>everything</em> is a hazard, where danger could come at you 
from <em>any</em> direction. Drivers must proceed slowly and cautiously to 
ensure safety under these conditions. When rules and regulations govern the 
driving environment, however, drivers are free to proceed with less concern 
and greater speed through those areas where the danger is significantly 
diminished by the order. The less uncertainty in the driving environment, 
the easier the drive—and the safer everyone is.</p>

<h3>Updated Traffic Laws and Driving Techniques</h3>

<h4>Recently Changed Traffic Laws</h4>

<p>(All regulations effective January 1, 2021, unless otherwise noted.)</p>

<p><strong>Points Assessed for Distracted Driving Convictions</strong></p>

<p>The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will assess a point on a 
person's driving record for a conviction of driving while operating a 
handheld wireless telephone or an electronic wireless communications 
device that occurs within 36 months of a prior conviction for the same 
offense, if the second conviction occurs after July 1, 2021. (Prior to 
this law, no points were assessed for such convictions.)</p>
<!-- (amends CVC 12810.3) -->

<p><strong>"Move Over" Requirements Extended to Highways</strong></p>

<p>Drivers who approach and overtake working emergency or service 
vehicles that are stopped with their warning lights flashing must take 
care to pass safely. The law requires that you approach with caution, 
and you must vacate the lane adjacent to such vehicles when another lane 
is available in your direction of travel and a lane change can be made 
safely (unless instructed otherwise by an official directing traffic). 
Drivers who cannot safely make a lane change are to slow down and pass 
at a speed that is safe for the existing conditions. (These requirements 
do not apply if the vehicle that is displaying flashing warning lights 
is not adjacent to the highway or is separated from the highway by a 
protective physical barrier.) Vehicles requiring these considerations 
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a stationary authorized emergency vehicle that is displaying 
emergency lights</li>
<li>a stationary tow truck that is displaying flashing amber 
warning lights</li>
<li>a stationary marked Department of Transportation vehicle 
that is displaying flashing amber warning lights</li>
<li>a stopped waste service vehicle displaying flashing amber 
lights, including such vehicles stopped on any public street</li>
</ul>

<p>(Previously, penalties were only imposed for drivers who failed to 
take precautions and make a safe space for emergency vehicles stopped 
on freeways.)</p>
<!-- (amends CVC 21809) -->

<p><strong>Civil/Criminal Liability Protection for Helping a Child in 
a Hot Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>California law now exempts "good Samaritans" from liability for 
property damage or trespass to a motor vehicle if damage was caused 
while the person was, in good faith, removing from a vehicle a child 
6 years of age or younger who was in immediate danger from heat, cold, 
lack of adequate ventilation, or other circumstances that could 
reasonably be expected to cause suffering, disability, or death.</p>
<!-- (adds �43.102 to the Civil Code;? 
adds �1799.101 to the Health and Safety Code) -->

<p><strong>Knowledge Test May Be Waived for Commercial Licensing</strong></p>

<p>The DMV is now authorized to waive both the knowledge test and the 
driving skills test, for applicants for a commercial driver license, 
for current or former members of the United States Armed Forces who 
meet certain specified requirements related to their experience 
operating a commercial vehicle in the Armed Forces, and to waive the 
testing requirements, as specified, for a hazardous materials, tank 
vehicle, or passenger endorsement for current or former members of the 
United States Armed Forces who meet certain specified requirements 
related to their experience operating a commercial vehicle in the Armed 
Forces.</p>
<!-- (amends CVC1651.3 and 15250) -->

<p><strong>Hi-Lo Warning Sounds for Emergency Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>Emergency vehicles are now authorized to be equipped with a "Hi-Lo" 
audible warning sound (defined as "a nonsiren sound alternating between 
a fixed high and a fixed low frequency") that may be used solely for the 
purpose of notifying the public of an immediate need to evacuate an area 
in an emergency.</p>
<!-- (amends CVC 27002) -->

<!-- ***  in effect from January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2026  ***
<p><strong>Ignition Interlock for DUI License Reinstatement</strong></p>

<p>Most DUI-alcohol repeat offenders and DUI-alcohol first-time offenders 
involved in an injury crash are required to install an ignition interlock 
device (IID) on their vehicles for 6 to 48 months in order to have their 
full license reinstated.</p>
<!-- (amends, repeals, and adds CVC 13352, 13352.4, 13353.3, 13353.4, 13353.5, 
13386, 23103.5, 23247, 23573, 23575, 23576, and 23597; 
adds and repeals CVC 13353.6, 13353.75, 13390, 23575.3, and 23575.5; 
amends ��9807, 9848, and 9882.14 of the Business and Professions Code) -->

<h4>Changes to Technology</h4>

<p><strong>Autonomous Vehicles and "Connected Cars"</strong></p>

<p>Automobiles are becoming ever more…well, automated. Today, some 
vehicles can parallel park themselves, monitor and adjust the distance 
from the vehicle ahead while in cruise control mode, and help drivers to 
brake for or steer around hazards. Many vehicle manufacturers are getting 
into the automated vehicle race, and as the infrastructure needed to 
support autonomous vehicles proliferates, the trend is likely to accelerate. 
Recent speculation suggests that we'll likely see "semi-autonomous" 
vehicles on roadways before 2025, while fully self-driving cars could be 
transporting folks around by 2035.</p>

<p>The principle deterrent to the widespread adoption of self-driving 
vehicles will be the cost. It's estimated that self-driving technology 
will add $7,000 – $10,000 to a vehicle's sticker price by 2025. But 
that should drop to about $5,000 by 2030, and $3,000 in 2035. And some 
of that expense is likely to be recouped in the form of reduced insurance 
premiums for self-driving autos; it's expected that crash rates will 
plunge to near-zero for self-driving vehicles. (Although other cars will 
likely continue to run into autonomous vehicles, overall collision rates 
will decline steadily as the share of self-driving vehicles on the 
roadways grows.) Traffic congestion, fuel usage, and air pollution should 
also drop, as autonomous vehicles can be programmed to be more efficient 
in their driving patterns.</p>

<p>Indeed, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is so convinced 
of the benefits of collision avoidance systems that it has reiterated 
its desire that they become standard equipment on all new passenger and 
commercial vehicles, suggesting they could prevent thousands of deaths 
and injuries each year. Forward collision avoidance systems include 
collision warning monitors that alert a driver that a crash is imminent 
and can assist with braking. Other technologies include electronic 
stability control and warnings that a vehicle has veered out of its lane. 
The NTSB recommended auto manufacturers make collision avoidance systems 
standard equipment beginning with collision warning systems, then add 
autonomous emergency braking systems once standards for those technologies 
are completed. The NTSB is also recommending that the NHTSA rate the 
performance of each vehicle's collision avoidance systems and add those 
results to that agency's safety rating scale. The board further issued 
a safety alert for consumers encouraging them to consider vehicles with 
collision warnings and emergency braking functions.</p>

<p>Direct monitoring of the vehicle environment is just one means of 
avoiding collisions. Another promising technological advance involves 
"connected" cars (or vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication): automobiles 
that can wirelessly "talk" to one another and to roadway infrastructure 
(e.g., traffic signals). The U.S. Department of Transportation is involved 
in a $42 million pilot project in New York City, Tampa, and Wyoming with 
the goal of cutting down on traffic problems and crashes. Sensor-enabled 
vehicles will lead to an unprecedented amount of anonymous data that could 
help to build smarter cities in the future. In the meantime, apps using 
the data could alert drivers of a vehicle in their blind spot or around 
a blind curve/corner or of vehicles braking ahead of them.</p>

<p>Despite the advantages of these technological advances, many consumers 
seem reluctant to cede too much control to autonomous vehicles. A recent 
survey found that only about 16% of respondents wanted a fully self-driving 
vehicle, and nearly 44% didn't want their cars to do <em>any driving at 
all</em>. Another recent poll found that only about 25% of respondents 
would trust an autonomous parking system—even though such systems 
have been around for years and are widely regarded as being safe and more 
effective at parking than human drivers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drivers using self-parking systems experienced 81% fewer 
curb strikes.</li>
<li>Self-parking systems parallel parked the vehicle using 47% 
fewer maneuvers, with some systems completing the task in as 
little as one maneuver.</li>
<li>Self-parking systems were able to park a vehicle 10% faster.</li>
<!-- <li>Self-parking systems were able to park 37% closer to the 
curb.</li> -->
</ul>

<p>The point is that drivers shouldn't fear or put off a future when their 
vehicle takes over (at least some of) the driving duties. While driving can 
certainly be an enjoyable experience that motorists might <em>choose</em> 
to engage in, some driving tasks—especially tedious ones, like 
parking—can safely and easily be turned over to autonomous systems.</p>

<p>One night, a police officer was staking out a particularly 
rowdy bar for possible violations of the driving-under-the-influence 
laws. At closing time, he saw a fellow stumble out of the bar, 
trip on the curb, and try his keys on five different cars before 
he found his. Then, the fellow sat in the front seat fumbling 
around with his keys for several minutes. Everyone left the bar 
and drove off. Finally, he started his engine and began to pull 
away.</p>

<p>The police officer was waiting for him. He stopped the driver, 
read him his rights, and administered the Breathalyzer test. The

<h4>Changes in Driving Techniques</h4>

<p><strong>Speeding and Crash Risk</strong></p>

<p>The findings by a team of researchers at the University of Waterloo, 
in a first-of-its-kind study, suggest that <em>speeding</em> is the 
riskiest type of aggressive driving and the best predictor of vehicle 
crashes.</p>

<p>Researchers examined data from 28 million trips for possible links 
between four "bad-driving behaviors"—speeding, hard braking, hard 
acceleration, and hard cornering—and the likelihood of crashes. 
Speed was identified as "the most important driver behavior" affecting 
crash risk.</p>
<!-- https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyamohn/2019/08/28/no-need-for-speed-speedings-strong-link-to-crash-risk-highlighted-in-new-study/#29b1860060f3 (accessed 8/29/2019). -->

<p>This should come as no surprise, as speeding reduces a driver's 
ability to steer safely around curves or obstructions in the roadway, 
extends stopping distances, and increases the distance traveled while 
the driver reacts to a dangerous situation. Worse yet, when speeding is 
a contributing factor in a collision, the bodily harm and property 
damage is frequently more extreme than average. It's also worth noting 
that a ticket for speeding is consistently among the most common traffic 
citations issued by law enforcement.</p>

<p>So, for the well-being of everyone in the driving environment (and to 
avoid a repeat visit to traffic school?), always keep your speed legal 
and safe for the driving conditions!</p>

<p><strong>Hands-Free Tech Poses Hidden Dangers</strong></p>

<p>While many drivers <em>think</em> they're doing the right thing by 
using hands-free systems to interact with their mobile/connected devices 
behind the wheel, a recent study raises new and unexpected concerns 
regarding the use of phones and vehicle information systems while driving. 
First, hands-free technologies can mentally distract drivers even if their 
eyes are on the road and their hands are on the wheel. But researchers 
found that potentially unsafe levels of mental disruption can persist 
for up to 27 seconds after completing a distracting task. At just 25 mph, 
a vehicle travels more than the length of three football fields in that 
time!</p>

<p>The researchers discovered the residual effects of mental distraction 
while comparing hands-free technologies in multiple vehicles and several 
smartphones. The analysis found that <em>every system studied</em> 
increased mental distraction to potentially unsafe levels.</p>

<p>"The lasting effects of mental distraction pose a hidden and pervasive 
danger that would likely come as a surprise to most drivers," the study's 
sponsors noted. "[M]otorists could miss stop signs, pedestrians, and 
other vehicles while the mind is readjusting to the task of driving."</p>

<p>Drivers should exercise great caution while using voice-activated 
systems, even at seemingly safe moments when there is a lull in traffic 
or the vehicle is stopped at an intersection. The reality is that mental 
distractions persist and can impact driver attentiveness even after the 
light turns green.</p>

<h2>Careless Driving and Its Consequences</h2>

<p>We noted earlier that operating a motor vehicle is the single most 
dangerous thing that most people do every day. While this is true for 
all drivers—even those who are cautious and 
conscientious—it's especially true for those who are careless 
or inattentive behind the wheel. Unfortunately for all of you careless 
drivers, there are a myriad of potential consequences for those who 
disregard their responsibility to operate a vehicle in a safe manner.</p>

<h3>Damage to or Loss of a Vehicle</h3>

<p>A motor vehicle is likely to be among the most expensive purchases 
you'll make in your lifetime. Even those vehicles regarded as 
"affordable small cars" can set you back well over $15,000; the more 
exotic varieties easily sport prices north of six figures (Aston Martin, 
Mr. Bond?). And it's rare to find even previously owned vehicles that 
are a true bargain—unless they have high mileage or something 
significant wrong with them. Suffering damage to or the loss of a 
vehicle, then, can be financially crippling to the average person. And 
that's before the inconvenience of having to do without a vehicle for 
a time has been factored in.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Car_Wreck.jpg" alt="Car Wreck">
</div>

<p>Yet, damage to your vehicle, from a tiny scratch to a complete loss, 
is a distinct possibility when vehicles are operated in a careless 
manner. And it's not just <em>your</em> vehicle: If any damage was 
caused by your careless driving, you'll be responsible for ensuring that 
anything else you damaged—including others' expensive 
vehicles—is repaired or replaced as well.</p>

<p>Of course, you can lose your vehicle in more ways than by getting 
into a crash. California traffic laws stipulate situations in which a 
vehicle may be seized and impounded by authorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol and/or 
other drugs</li>
<li>possession of an alcoholic beverage in the vehicle when you 
are under the age of 21</li>
<li>conviction for engaging in a motor vehicle speed contest</li>
<li>conviction for exhibition of speed on a highway</li>
<li>operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver license</li>
<li>allowing an unlicensed person to drive your vehicle</li>
<!--CVC 14607.6-->
<li>failing to provide proof of financial responsibility upon
the request of a law enforcement officer (at the discretion of 
the court)</li>
<!--CVC 16029-->
<li>leaving your vehicle in an unsafe place after a collision 
(unless it is disabled)</li>
</ul>

<p>While "losing" your vehicle in this manner is generally a temporary 
situation, it's likely to be expensive to retrieve it from the impound 
yard. And you will undoubtedly be greatly inconvenienced during the time 
it's gone.</p>

<h3>Injury or Death</h3>

<p>As devastating as the loss of a vehicle might be, trust us when we 
tell you that it's really among the best case scenarios for those 
involved in a crash. The losses could easily extend to life and limb!</p>

<p>You'd recover quickly enough from a few scratches, of course. But the 
forces that can be generated by objects of the mass and velocity of a 
speeding motor vehicle are tremendous. Those forces are enough to easily 
break bones, tear flesh, and shred organs.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Mummy-Crutches.jpg" alt="Mummy on Crutches">
</div>

<p>Now…imagine others are involved. Perhaps you had a passenger 
in your vehicle; or maybe you struck a pedestrian or a vehicle 
containing others. You might be responsible for injuring, perhaps 
seriously and permanently, another person. Worse still, you might be 
responsible for <em>killing</em> that person! You could be financially 
liable for that person's medical bills and for their lost wages if they 
were injured severely enough to miss work. But think for a moment of 
the remorse you'd feel for taking another life. Perhaps it was a young 
person, or a parent whose children will never see them again. You would 
be responsible for these losses—and all because you failed to 
show the proper care and respect for the powerful vehicle you were 
operating.</p>

<p>It can be grim to consider. But you'll greatly increase your odds 
of avoiding such a fate if you simply drive responsibly!</p>

<h3>Insurance Increase</h3>

<p>As a driver, you're aware that insurance doesn't come cheap. A bad 
driving record will further boost those rates. But…just how 
much will a blip on your record cost you? Plenty! A study conducted 
by an insurance industry clearinghouse found that drivers who had one 
or more moving violations on their record could face skyrocketing 
quotes on their automobile insurance.</p>

<ul>
<li>One violation led to an average annual premium increase 
of 18%.</li>
<li>Two violations led to an average annual premium increase 
of 34%.</li>
<li>Three violations led to an average annual premium increase 
of 53%.</li>
</ul>

<p>"The lesson is simple: drivers who speed, drink and drive, or engage 
in other bad driving behaviors will pay through the nose if they want 
to keep their car insurance," noted Chris Kissell, a managing editor. 
"The best way to save money on car insurance is to drive responsibly 
at all times."</p>

<h3>Financial Impact and Legal/DMV Actions</h3>

<p>Insurance companies aren't the only ones who are concerned about 
bad driving behaviors. When you drive carelessly, you're likely to 
have a run-in with a law enforcement officer at some point. If so, 
you'll probably have to pay a fine. Should you find yourself in front 
of a judge, you might have your vehicle or your driver license taken 
away. You might be sentenced to community service or even jail time 
if your actions presented an extreme threat to the safety of others.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Judge.jpg" alt="Judge">
</div>

<p>Independently of the courts, the DMV may take action against a 
driver's license. Driving is a privilege, after all, not a right. A 
<em>right</em> is something that is due a person by their very nature, 
and is irrevocable. A <em>privilege</em>, on the other hand, is an 
opportunity that is granted subject to the fulfillment of certain 
requirements and stipulations. Avoid the habit of thinking that the 
State of California owes you a driver's license—the State extends 
you the driving privilege only for as long as you prove to be a safe 
and responsible driver!</p>

<p>The State has several options when it comes to taking action against 
your driving privilege:</p>

<p><strong>Probation:</strong> As an alternative to suspension, drivers 
can be given a "stern warning" for a relatively minor offense and 
allowed to keep their license. Those who reoffend before the 
probationary period is up will have their license suspended.</p>

<p><strong>Suspension:</strong> Under suspension, a person's driving 
privileges are "temporarily withdrawn"—either by a judge as 
part of some criminal penalty, or by the DMV as a result of point 
accumulation or because it has been determined that the person 
presents a danger on the road. Drivers who have had their license 
suspended because of a DMV administrative action may get their license 
back at the end of the suspension period by applying to the DMV for 
reinstatement and demonstrating proof of financial responsibility. If 
the license was suspended due to a physical or mental condition, the 
DMV may require the person to submit to any examination deemed 
appropriate to demonstrate the ability to safely operate a motor 
vehicle.</p>

<p>Your license may be suspended for up to six months for:</p>

<ul>
<li>failure to stop at the scene of a collision in which you 
were involved</li>
<li>failure to stop at a railroad crossing</li>
<li>evading a peace officer (if the driver's license is not 
revoked for this violation)</li>
<li>knowingly participating in a vehicular collision for the 
purposes of insurance fraud</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you cannot escape suspension by simply ignoring traffic 
citations. Should you fail to appear in court (FTA) for a traffic 
citation, the court will notify the DMV and the FTA will appear on your 
driving record. Likewise, failure to pay a fine (FTP) will cause the 
court to notify the DMV and the FTP will appear on your record. Even 
one FTA or FTP on your record can lead the DMV to suspend your license. 
Ending the suspension will cost you a reissue fee and—oh, 
yeah—you'll have to go to court anyway to get the issue resolved. 
In short…take care of those traffic citations, because they won't 
go away on their own!</p>

<p><strong>Revocation:</strong> This means that a person's privilege to 
operate a motor vehicle has been terminated, usually as the result of a 
very serious offense that indicates a blatant disregard for the safety 
of others. For instance, the DMV will revoke your license for a conviction 
of failure to stop at the scene of an accident in which you were involved 
that resulted in an injury or death to a person or of evading a peace 
officer. Drivers who have had their license revoked may reapply for a new 
license after the period of revocation expires (with all of the "fun" that 
applying for a brand new license brings).</p>

<h3>The Negligent Operator Treatment System</h3>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Coach.jpg" alt="Coach">
<div class="caption">Sometimes, folks just need a <br>
little coaching to drive better.</div>
</div>

<p>One of the ways that the State of California manages its licensed 
drivers is through the <em>Negligent Operator Treatment System 
(NOTS)</em>. The idea behind NOTS is simple: Just as a small subset 
of the population tends to commit crimes repeatedly, accounting for 
a disproportionate amount of the overall crime rate, so are there
operators who tend to repeatedly drive in a careless or unsafe manner. 
These repeat offenders account for a disproportionate amount of 
danger on the roadway. NOTS is an automated system that identifies as 
negligent those motorists who are repeatedly cited by law enforcement 
or involved in collisions. The underlying assumption is that motorists 
who repeatedly drive in a negligent manner become accustomed to unsafe 
driving techniques, ultimately becoming a menace as their repertoire 
of bad habits grows.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that NOTS isn't just a punitive program. 
<em>Treatment</em> is a part of the title—and a part of the 
scheme. The DMV seeks to use the program to improve the habits of 
chronically negligent drivers. They counsel those whom the program 
identifies, and monitor the rehabilitation of negligent drivers with 
an assessment tool called a <em>Driver Improvement Analysis</em>.</p>

<h4>Points on Your Record</h4>

<p>The DMV maintains a record of every driver's traffic convictions and 
collisions, with each incident remaining on the record for 36 months 
(or longer, for a few very serious violations). Each infraction has a 
point value attached to it, and it is a total of these points that is 
monitored by NOTS.</p>

<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>

<p><strong>One point</strong> is assessed to a driving record for a 
variety of "lesser" violations, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>speeding</li>
<li>running a red light/stop sign</li>
<li>turning violations</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Writing_Ticket.jpg" alt="Writing a Ticket" style="padding-right:40px;">
</div>

<p><strong>Two points</strong> are assessed to a record for more 
serious violations, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>reckless driving</li>
<li>driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs</li>
<li>hit-and-run driving</li>
<li>operating a motor vehicle while your license is suspended 
or revoked</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Collisions</strong></p>

<p>Any collision in which a driver is determined by law enforcement 
personnel to be "at fault" will result in a <strong>one-point 
assessment</strong> to the driver's record.</p>

<h4>Point Accumulation</h4>

<p>NOTS responds on a sliding scale, depending on a driver's point 
count:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a driver accumulates two points within a 12-month 
period, the person is sent a warning letter.</li>
<li>When a driver accumulates three points within a 12-month 
period, the person is sent a Notice of Intent to Suspend. 
Assessment of another point will result in a suspension.</li>
<li>When a driver accumulates four points within a 12-month 
period, the driver's license is suspended for six months.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drivers will be considered "negligent"—and will have their 
license suspended for six months—if their driving record exhibits 
any of the following point totals (regardless of license class):</p>

<ul>
<li>4 points in 12 months</li>
<li>6 points in 24 months</li>
<li>8 points in 36 months</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact on Quality of Life</h3>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/New_Car.jpg" alt="New Car">
<div class="caption">You think of your fantasy car as the key <br>
to the good life. But, with great power <br>
comes great responsibility!</div>
</div>

<p>You probably think of that wallet-sized plastic wafer known as a 
driver license as your ticket to freedom and independence. There's 
nothing quite like driving your own vehicle and tailoring your 
schedule to your own wants and needs. Life can be so much fuller when 
you can slip behind the wheel and be whisked away to wherever you 
want to be: to a friend's or relative's house, to the beach, to the 
mountains, to the store, to museums, libraries, schools, 
theaters…. The list of exotic locales is nearly endless, and 
the possibilities exciting!</p>

<p>As you might imagine, you're not the only one who has these dreams 
and aspirations. All of the other drivers out there feel the same way. 
It's easy to get caught up in the hype. But drivers must remember that 
this fanciful lifestyle is the very thing that can be lost when a motor 
vehicle is operated in a careless manner. As we discussed in detail 
above, you could wind up losing your license or your vehicle, your 
financial security, or the full functioning of your body. You might 
even wind up losing your life. Or, you could wind up depriving someone 
else of these things.</p>

<p>In the end, this is why you need to take great care to always drive 
responsibly!</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Wrecked_Car.jpg" alt="Wrecked Car">
<div class="caption">Collisions don't "just happen." <br>
They often happen because <br>
drivers do careless things, like… <br>
driving at an unsafe speed.</div>
</div>

<h3>Contributing Factors Can Cause Collisions</h3>

<p>The fact of the matter is that very few collisions "just happen." 
They most often follow from episodes of careless driving and involve 
certain <em>contributing factors</em>. The actions that most commonly 
culminate in a crash include:</p>

<ul>
<li>driving at an unsafe speed</li>
<li>driving on the wrong side of the road</li>
<li>turning improperly</li>
<li>violating right-of-way rules</li>
<li>failing to stop at stop sign/signal</li>
<li>operating a vehicle while distracted</li>
<li>operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of 
alcohol or other drugs</li>
</ul>

<p>This course discusses these bad driving behaviors in detail, and 
provides some simple advice on how you can best avoid the dangers of 
these actions. By taking a little care and driving more responsibly, 
you can greatly decrease your odds of getting into a dangerous 
collision.</p>

<h3>DUI and Its Additional Impact</h3>

<p>A significant contributing factor in collisions is the operation of 
a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs 
(DUI). It is, perhaps, the most careless thing that a driver could ever 
do.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Alcoholism.jpg" alt="Alcoholism">
</div>

<h4>Legal Consequences</h4>

<p>If you are convicted of driving with an excessively high BAC, or 
while under the influence of either alcohol or drugs or both (DUI), 
you may be sentenced to serve up to six months in jail and to pay a 
fine of between $390 and $1,000 (plus penalty assessments) for a first 
conviction. In addition, your vehicle may be impounded and is subject 
to storage fees. On a first conviction, the court will suspend your 
driving privileges for six months. You will be required to demonstrate 
financial responsibility and to complete a DUI program before the 
driving privilege can be reinstated. The length of the treatment 
program may vary.</p>

<p>Generally, if you are over 21 and enroll in a DUI program, 
demonstrate proof of insurance, and pay the restriction and reissue 
fees, the DMV will issue you a restricted driver license. This allows 
you to drive to and from work as well as on-the-job (unless you hold a 
commercial license), and to and from a DUI program. However, if your 
driving would be considered a public safety risk, the court may order 
the DMV not to grant a restricted license. (Other actions against you 
may also prohibit the issuance of a restricted license.)</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Drunk_Drive_Arrest.jpg" alt="Drunk Drive Arrest">
</div>

<p>DUI convictions remain on your driving record for ten years, and the 
courts and/or DMV may impose more stringent penalties for subsequent 
violations during that period. For example, a court may order a 10-year 
revocation of the driver license of a person who has been convicted of 
three or more separate violations of driving while under the influence 
of an alcoholic beverage or for causing bodily injury to a person other 
than the driver while driving while under the influence of an alcoholic 
beverage (in addition to all of the other penalties that may be imposed 
in such circumstances).</p>
<!-- CVC 23597 -->

<p><strong>Misdemeanor vs Felony Convictions</strong>

</p><p><strong>Misdemeanor DUI Conviction.</strong> If you are stopped for 
a DUI before you cause injury or death, you will most likely be charged 
with a misdemeanor count of DUI. This is punishable by fines and/or jail 
time and/or other sanctions.</p>

<p><strong>Felony DUI Conviction.</strong> When injury or death results 
from your DUI, the charge will be felony DUI. A DUI felony is treated as 
harshly as any other felony. You can spend years in prison, depending on 
the severity of the results of your actions. In recent years, drivers 
have been convicted of second-degree murder for a felony DUI! You might 
also be punished under California's "Three Strikes" Law, as well as face 
a civil lawsuit.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Inmate.jpg" alt="Inmate"></div>

<h4>Financial Impact</h4>

<p>Having "one for the road" might cost you more than you think. Most 
people are aware that drinking and driving is a dangerous choice that 
can lead to property damage, injuries, and even death. But they often 
fail to consider all of the financial consequences until it's too late. 
The costs of a DUI are staggering, from court costs, fines, and 
attorneys' fees, to treatment programs, probation, and higher insurance 
premiums.</p>

<p>Sure, you were thirsty that night. But is any beer really worth 
<em>that</em> kind of money? Think of the other ways it could be 
better spent!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We haven't even considered any costs and 
penalties that might be incurred in a civil trial which results from 
death or injury you cause by operating a vehicle while impaired. If 
the above totals are large, they could be just the tip of the iceberg!</p>

<p>Finally, if you are convicted of DUI, you will have a criminal record, 
and you will have to report the conviction on most employment and loan 
applications. Employers and lenders may think twice about taking a 
chance on you; and if you are convicted a second time, you can probably 
forget about being considered at all.</p>

<h4>Emotional Impact</h4>

<p>After suffering through all of the penalties handed out for 
conviction for DUI, you'd likely be feeling pretty bad about your 
situation. That's probably intentional—because driving under 
the influence of alcohol or other drugs is <em>so</em> dangerous, 
the punishments are designed to be harsh and certain so you (and 
others) will be discouraged from ever engaging in the activity.</p>

<p>Imagine how down you might feel if you have been maimed or 
handicapped as the result of an alcohol-related crash. Worse still, 
imagine suffering a lifetime of guilt and anguish because you harmed or 
killed someone else while driving under the influence—especially 
when you consider how easy it could have been to avoid such an outcome. 
Before you operate a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol or other 
drugs, ask yourself if it's worth it.</p>

<p>But enough about you. How might your DUI impact others?</p>

<h4>Victims and Their Families</h4>

<p>Imagine how <em>your</em> family might react to your DUI. They 
could find themselves sharing in the inconveniences imposed on you 
by the legal penalties handed out for your offense. They might also 
experience a sense of shame over your actions—especially in those 
cases where there was a catastrophic outcome. Or, imagine how your 
loved ones might react if you were injured or killed in a crash that 
resulted from your DUI. They might have to take care of you. At the 
very least, the quality of your life with your family might be 
diminished. Worse still, you might not be able to provide for them as 
you did previously. Or you might not be there for them at all….</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Missing_Mom.jpg" alt="Missing Mom">
<div class="caption">Your drunk driving might not <br>
affect just you. It can also impact <br>
your family—or the families of <br>
your victims.</div>
</div>

<p>Imagine how a victim of your DUI might feel. This person is an 
innocent casualty of your irresponsible behavior. It might even be a 
friend or relative whose life is changed forever in a tragic turn of 
events. You'll likely feel no less sorry for a stranger who just 
happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, of course. Still, 
no matter your level of intimacy with the victim(s) of your DUI, no 
matter how unintentional the results, you remain accountable for the 
negative effects of your actions.</p>

<p>Finally, imagine how your DUI might affect the family of a victim 
of your DUI. They're likely to face the same challenges that your 
family might: They could be forced to cope with diminished 
capabilities—or the loss—of a loved one. Their lives are 
likely to be forever changed for the worse. They have no one to blame 
but you for their unfortunate position, and it was all the result of 
a grossly irresponsible and easily avoidable act. You'll forgive them 
if they seem a little hostile.</p>

<h4>Societal Impact</h4>

<p>Society, in general, also suffers from the repercussions of DUI. 
The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes in the United States totals 
well over $51 billion. Because the reduced reaction times of drivers 
under the influence of alcohol prevent those operators from slowing 
their vehicles or avoiding hazards as effectively as sober drivers, 
emergency room and other medical costs are generally higher for 
alcohol-related crashes. These generally more destructive crashes 
also mean that time and productivity losses in the workplace can be 
significantly higher.</p>

<p>In the end, drinking (or taking other drugs) and driving is a 
careless and irresponsible action that can have a variety of negative 
consequences for everyone involved, for those close to them, and for 
society. The best course of action, then, is to <em>NEVER</em> consume 
alcohol or other drugs before you drive!</p>

<h2>Operator Responsibilities</h2>

<p>The old joke says that the most important piece of safety equipment 
on a motor vehicle is the nut behind the wheel. All joking aside, that 
means <em>you</em>. And the point of the message should be clear: Each 
driver is responsible to ensure that they operate their vehicles 
safely.</p>

<p>Drivers must be physically capable of safely operating a vehicle, 
of course. Although the variety of assist systems and adaptive devices 
available to today's drivers mean that <em>most</em> motorists can be 
accommodated, there a few requirements to remain mindful of. Perhaps 
more importantly, however, are the psychological and environmental 
factors that can affect any driver's ability to safely operate a vehicle 
at any time. It is every driver's responsibility to be aware of these 
factors and to respond appropriately to them—even by abstaining 
from operating a vehicle under extremely adverse conditions.</p>

<p>Drivers are also expected to know the rules of the road and when 
and how to apply them. Finally, drivers owe a certain amount of 
consideration to those with whom they share the road, and are, in part, 
responsible for their safety.</p>

<h3>Knowing When Not to Drive</h3>

<h4>Personal Concerns</h4>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Blindfolded.jpg" alt="Blindfolded">
</div>

<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>

<p>Nearly all of the sensory input we need to safely operate a motor 
vehicle comes from visual cues. If you cannot see clearly, you will 
have difficulty detecting hazardous situations and judging distances. 
And you need peripheral vision to detect vehicles coming up beside you 
("out of the corner of your eye") as you focus on the road ahead.</p>

<p>Unless you intend to restrict your driving to certain times of 
day, you must also be able to see well under a variety of lighting 
conditions. Many drivers who see clearly in the daytime may see poorly 
at night. They may not be able to see well in dim lighting conditions, 
or they may have trouble with the glare from the headlights of 
approaching vehicles.</p>

<p>In California, anyone who applies for an original or renewal driver 
license must pass a DMV-administered visual acuity screening. You must 
have corrected or uncorrected vision of:</p>

<ul>
<li>20/40 with both eyes tested together and</li>
<li>20/40 in one eye and</li>
<li>20/70, at least, in the other eye</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Mad_Scientist.jpg" alt="Mad Scientist">
<div class="caption">If you needed corrective <br>
lenses to pass the vision <br>
exam, you must wear them <br>
when driving!</div>
</div>

<p>If you cannot meet the vision screening standard, you will be 
referred to a vision specialist. Upon your return to the DMV with a 
completed and signed (by your eye doctor) Report of Vision Examination, 
your vision will be retested. You will also have to take a driving test 
to demonstrate that you can drive safely, even though your vision is 
impaired. Passing the driving test establishes that you can compensate 
for the visual deficiencies that you have. By law, however, you will be 
refused a license if you do not have a minimum visual acuity in at least 
one eye that is better than 20/200 (best corrected, without the use of 
a bioptic telescopic lens or similar device).</p>

<p>Drivers who needed corrective lenses in order to pass the vision 
screening are required to wear those lenses whenever they operate a 
motor vehicle. This restriction will be noted on their license.</p>

<p>Everyone, but especially drivers, should get regular eye 
examinations—at least once every year or two. If you need 
corrective lenses, you can get the prescription updated (as needed) at 
that time. And you may not realize that you've lost peripheral vision 
or distance judgment unless you have your eyes checked by a healthcare 
professional. A complete eye exam will also reveal any diseases of the 
eye, many of which can be treated simply and effectively thanks to 
advancements in medical science.</p>

<p><strong>Fatigue/Drowsiness</strong></p>

<p><em>Fatigue</em> is the decreased capacity to function normally 
because of excessive stimulation or exertion, and usually manifests 
itself as drowsiness or a general weariness. It can be caused by a lack 
of sleep; physical overexertion; overeating (which reroutes blood from 
your brain to your stomach and releases hormones that may make you 
drowsy); driving down long, monotonous stretches of road; or 
physiological overload caused by prolonged stress. Fatigue compromises 
your ability to concentrate, slows your reaction time, and may affect 
your ability to control the vehicle.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Sleepdriver.jpg" alt="Sleepdriver">
<div class="caption">Don't be like this fellow. <br>
When you're too tired to <br>
drive safely, reach for <br>
a pillow, not the clutch.</div>
</div>

<p>To avoid fatigue before starting out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get enough sleep on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Monitor your physical condition before entering your vehicle. 
If you feel extremely tired, do not drive.</li>
<li>Avoid driving late at night. Most drivers are less alert at 
night, especially after midnight.</li>
<li>Do not take any drugs that can make you drowsy.</li>
<li>Don't overeat, and attempt to space meals so that digestion 
doesn't require so much from your body that it interferes with 
the task of driving.</li>
<li>Exercise can help you to build up endurance, but do not 
exercise vigorously just prior to driving long distances.</li>
</ul>

<p>To deal with fatigue that occurs during a trip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Split long drives into shorter segments, stopping and 
resting between segments whether you feel tired or not.</li>
<li>Move around during rest breaks to get your blood flowing.</li>
<li>Force yourself to attend to the driving task by checking 
mirrors, looking ahead, and keeping your eyes moving. This 
will help you to maintain alertness.</li>
<li>Try chewing gum or singing along with the radio.</li>
<li>Roll down your window to get some fresh air.</li>
<li>In extreme cases, pull over at a rest stop and take a nap.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stress</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, stress is a necessary and useful part of 
our lives, and we should welcome it—to a degree. Stress is a 
physiological reaction to unusual physical and/or emotional stimuli. 
The stress reaction often begins with a shot of adrenaline that raises 
our heart rate and sharpens our perceptions, preparing us to respond 
to the novel situation. While we tend to be less stressed by familiar 
environments and routine activities, few people would want their lives 
to be strictly routine all of the time.</p>

<p>Stress becomes an unwanted factor during the driving activity when 
it becomes acute to the point of distraction, however. Too much stress 
can leave us "hyped-up," and interfere with our ability to properly 
focus on the driving task. Alternately, stress can manifest itself as 
extreme tiredness. This also interferes with drivers' ability to perceive 
and appropriately process stimuli, and reduces the ability to react. As 
well, too much stress can lead to irritability and overreaction to minor 
inconveniences.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Stressed_Out.jpg" alt="Stressed Out">
<div class="caption">Stress and strong emotions <br>
take your mind off of the <br>
driving task and leave you <br>
unprepared to drive. Deal <br>
with these distractions <em>before</em> <br>
you get in the vehicle.</div>
</div>

<p>Monitor your stress level before entering the vehicle. If stress makes 
it impossible for you to remain courteous and attentive to the driving 
task, do not get behind the wheel until you can refocus.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional Distress</strong></p>

<p>It is not only "negative" emotions like anger and anxiety that lead 
to unsafe decisions while driving. The term <em>emotional distress</em> 
can apply equally to feelings of glee or jubilation, which can be just 
as distracting to drivers and cause them to speed or drive recklessly. 
When you've just heard that you're getting a big raise, for instance, 
you are likely to be thinking about how you'll spend the money rather 
than focusing on the driving conditions.</p>

<p>It is essential to realize that feelings impact driving habits. 
The key is to lessen the pressure of these feelings and reduce the 
probability that the driver will create a dangerous driving situation. 
If you find yourself emotionally agitated—in a positive <em>or</em> 
a negative way—wait until the feelings subside before putting the 
key in the ignition. And if you are suddenly overwhelmed by emotion 
while driving, whether the emotion is the resurgence of some earlier 
feelings or a new emotion created by driving conditions, you may have 
to pull over and let the feeling pass. If you can refocus on the driving 
task, this serves both to quell powerful emotions and to improve your 
driving performance.</p>

<p><strong>The Effects of Alcohol/Medication</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the most dangerous—and most irresponsible—thing 
you could ever do as a motorist is to drive under the influence of 
alcohol or other drugs! <strong>NEVER DRINK (OR USE OTHER DRUGS) AND 
DRIVE!</strong></p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Effects_of_Alcohol.jpg" alt="Effects of Alcohol">
</div>

<p><strong>Alcohol is a Drug.</strong> A toxin that can alter brain 
chemistry, alcohol is a powerful drug that can produce short-term 
behavioral changes and long-term physical addiction. Ultimately, the 
physiological stress of cleansing the body of alcohol contributes to 
the breakdown of many major anatomical systems.</p>

<p>Pharmacologically, alcohol is a depressant, and it is the most widely 
used—and abused—drug in the United States. When consumed, 
alcohol acts quickly to slow the function of the central nervous system. 
It suppresses brain activity and can act as a mild tranquilizer or a 
general anesthetic, depending on the dose. In very low quantities, it 
can appear to be a stimulant by curbing inhibitions. As alcohol 
concentration increases, however, further suppression of nervous 
functions produces the classic symptoms of impairment: slurred speech, 
an unsteady gait, disrupted sensory perceptions, and the inability to 
react in a timely manner. At high concentrations, alcohol produces 
general anesthesia. An acutely impaired person can enter a coma-like 
state and be difficult to rouse; in extreme cases, basic involuntary 
bodily functions (e.g., breathing and heartbeat) can cease and death 
can result.</p>

<p><strong>"Know Your Limits."</strong> One of the artifacts of the old 
way of thinking is that one can combine a "safe" level of drinking with 
driving. This outdated concept is summarized in the admonition to "know 
your limits." Today, traffic safety experts and addiction specialists 
understand that there are no safe limits to drinking and driving. 
Judgment is impaired by the first drink. Thus, even if a safe limit 
existed, the drinker is the last person who could competently judge 
whether he or she has had "too much." In short, <strong>NEVER DRINK (OR 
USE OTHER DRUGS) AND DRIVE!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Blood Alcohol Concentration.</strong> The amount of alcohol 
in the body is calculated as the grams of alcohol in the bloodstream per 
100 milliliters of blood, or the grams of alcohol in the breath per 210 
liters of breath. This number is known as <em>blood alcohol concentration</em> 
(often abbreviated as <em>BAC</em>, and sometimes referred to as <em>blood 
alcohol level</em> or <em>blood alcohol content</em>). Blood alcohol 
concentration is used to determine a driver's level of impairment. The 
law in California defines drivers as intoxicated if they test at 0.08% 
BAC or higher (in fact, in <em>most</em> states—although some 
jurisdictions are starting to enforce even lower limits (0.05%)). <!-- Drivers 
operating commercial vehicles&mdash;including those driving when a 
passenger for hire is in the vehicle (e.g., rideshare drivers)&mdash;are 
subject to a lower BAC limit: 0.04%. --></p>
<!-- CVC 23152, 23153 -->

<p>BAC will vary depending on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the amount of alcohol consumed</li>
<li>the time period over which the alcohol was consumed</li>
<li>the body mass (weight) of the individual</li>
<li>the individual's sensitivity to alcohol</li>
<li>the presence in the body of other chemicals</li>
<li>the type, amount, and recency of food consumed</li>
</ul>

<div align="center">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Alcohol_Equivalencies.jpg" alt="Alcohol Equivalencies">
<div class="caption">One "drink" = 1.5 oz. of 80 proof liquor, <br>
12 oz. of 5% beer, or 5 oz. of 12% wine.</div>
</div>

<p>The body naturally rids itself of alcohol at a rate of approximately 
0.01% BAC every 40 minutes. This is a purely physiological process, and 
an individual's rate of alcohol metabolism is relatively fixed; it 
cannot be accelerated by consuming coffee, taking a cold shower, or 
employing other folk remedies that supposedly help one to sober up more 
quickly.</p>
<!--"2011 Driver Handbook," p. 81.-->

<p><strong>Effects of Alcohol on the Driving Task.</strong> By 
inhibiting certain normal bodily functions, alcohol can significantly 
hamper the ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Woman_Drunk.jpg" alt="Woman Drunk">
</div>

<p>Alcohol can impact <strong>vision</strong> by hindering the reflex 
action of the eyes. This is especially important at night (when most 
drunk driving incidents occur) when a driver faces the headlights of 
an oncoming vehicle. Normally, the pupils of the eyes constrict to 
shut out excess light. Alcohol impairs this natural reaction, allowing 
too much light to strike the retinas and temporarily blinding the driver. 
Even after there are no more oncoming vehicles, the eyes take longer 
to readjust to the darkness, causing the driver's vision to remain 
maladapted.</p>

<p>Under all lighting conditions, visual acuity deteriorates after only a 
few drinks. Muscles in the eye lose their precision, leaving the impaired 
driver with fuzzy, blurred—or even doubled—vision. A 
diminished sense of peripheral vision can lead to "tunnel vision." Finally, 
alcohol affects depth perception, causing impaired drivers to miscalculate 
the distance of oncoming or cross traffic, and to misjudge the speed of 
both their own vehicles and others'.</p>

<p>Alcohol impacts <strong>judgment</strong>. Since drinking produces 
euphoria and a sense of well-being, drivers under the influence tend to 
take more risks on the roadway. Ironically, impaired drivers choose to 
engage in more dangerous behavior even as alcohol robs them of the 
higher cognitive functions necessary to anticipate hazards and 
accurately gauge speed and stopping distance.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Googley.jpg" alt="Googley">
<div class="caption">Alcohol disrupts judgment and <br>
reason, sensory perception, and <br>
physical coordination. In clinical <br>
terms, it makes you all "googley."</div>
</div>

<p>Alcohol slows our <strong>reaction times</strong>. As higher brain 
functions—anticipation and judgment—deteriorate, muscular 
reflexes slow. This lack of muscular coordination often manifests 
itself as a stumbling and weaving gait. In a vehicle, it can manifest 
itself as difficulty in steering and braking properly. Between the 
slowness to recognize a hazard and the slowness to get a foot to the 
brake, reaction time for an intoxicated driver is significantly 
increased. At highway speeds, when a vehicle is moving almost 100 feet 
per second, an impaired driver who loses just two seconds of reaction 
time adds 200 feet to the vehicle's stopping distance!</p>

<p>Finally, alcohol compromises <strong>simultaneous task 
execution</strong>. Every driving maneuver requires the ability to 
handle several tasks at once. The inability to coordinate the efforts 
needed to safely operate a motor vehicle makes an impaired driver 
extremely dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> California's impaired-driving laws 
specifically prohibit the drinking of any alcoholic beverage or the 
smoking or other ingestion of marijuana or any marijuana product while 
driving, or while riding as a passenger in, a motor vehicle. Moreover, 
the law forbids a person from having in their possession, while driving, 
any receptacle containing an alcoholic beverage which has been opened or 
has a seal broken, or the contents of which have been partially removed. 
Likewise, a person may not have in their possession, while driving, any 
receptacle containing cannabis or cannabis products which has been opened 
or has a seal broken, or a loose cannabis flower not in a container 
(unless these are in the trunk of the vehicle); and it is illegal for 
someone to consume any cannabis or cannabis product while riding as a 
passenger in a bus, limousine, taxi, pedicab, housecar, or camper, 
though passengers in any of these vehicles are able to drink alcoholic 
beverages.</p>
<!-- CVC 23220, 23221, 23222; 23229 -->

<p><strong>Other Drugs.</strong> Safety and public health officials 
now recognize that the driving task can also be negatively impacted 
by drugs other than alcohol. In turn, law enforcement officers have 
become more sophisticated at detecting these drugs in drivers, and 
penalties that were once meted out for alcohol have been extended to 
other types of chemical intoxicants.</p>

<p>Drugs fall into three categories: prescription drugs, non-prescription 
drugs, and illegal drugs. All of these drugs can have as profound an 
effect on the mental and physical skills necessary for the safe operation 
of a motor vehicle as does alcohol. When you take drugs and drive, you 
may be "driving under the influence" just as certainly as if you were 
to consume alcohol and get behind the wheel.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Medications.jpg" alt="Medications">
</div>

<p><strong>Prescription medications</strong> are drugs that are taken 
under the supervision of a medical professional for specific symptoms. 
The term <em>prescription medication</em> covers a wide variety of 
pharmacologically active chemicals. Regardless of the specific effects, 
you need to be careful when driving after having taken prescription 
medications. Read the warning labels on your medicine bottles carefully. 
They list a drug's effects and the activities that should be avoided 
while taking the medication. Heed those warnings.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that a prescription is legal only for the person for 
whom it was written and in the dosage specified. Barring that, it's 
just another illegal drug. Over the past several years, the abuse of 
prescription drugs has become one of the biggest problems facing 
public health officials. Ways of abusing include overmedicating with 
prescription drugs and/or obtaining them with counterfeit 
prescriptions. Be aware that taking prescriptions not written for you 
is not only against the law, it is unsafe. Prescriptions are tailored 
to the individual for whom they are written, making the dosage and/or 
drug content potentially hazardous to someone taking it casually.</p>

<p><strong>Non-prescription medications</strong> are drugs that are 
sold over-the-counter at commercial retail outlets. Often, they are 
merely less powerful variants of prescription medications. 
Over-the-counter medications such as headache remedies, cold pills, 
and cough syrups can make you just as drowsy as their prescribed 
cousins, however. Non-prescription medications also come with warning 
labels that should be read and obeyed.</p>

<div class="caption">Marijuana is often considered <br>
a depressant, but it has effects <br>
which could place it in other <br>
categories as well.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Classes of Drugs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Depressants:</strong> Earlier, we mentioned that 
alcohol is a depressant. It is just one drug in an extensive 
list of chemicals that slow the functioning of the central 
nervous system. Depressants are the most widely prescribed, 
used, and abused substances, and the category also includes 
barbiturates, antihistamines, and tranquilizers. Depressants 
induce drowsiness and diminish the normal activity of the 
brain.</li>
<li><strong>Narcotics:</strong> Narcotics are actually extremely 
powerful depressants. They are highly addictive, and should only 
be taken under a doctor's supervision. Heroin, morphine, and 
codeine are all narcotics. These quick-acting drugs cause 
drowsiness and loss of motor control. As they depress the 
central nervous system, they affect vision and judgment. 
Withdrawal from narcotics can cause visual and auditory 
hallucinations, sweating and shaking, great physical discomfort, 
and unconsciousness. Compromised higher cognitive functions 
caused by the effects of narcotics lead to slowed reaction 
time.</li>
<li><strong>Stimulants:</strong> Stimulants have the opposite 
effect from depressants: they speed up the central nervous 
system. Stimulants include such things as diet aids, 
amphetamines, and cocaine. The caffeine in coffee, tea, soft 
drinks, and energy drinks is classified as a stimulant. By 
stimulating the central nervous system these drugs can fragment 
attention. Critical tasks, such as anticipation and preparation 
for hazards, are compromised. A large enough dose of a stimulant 
can cause the user to become "wired" or jittery, resulting in 
erratic behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Hallucinogens:</strong> Drugs classified as 
hallucinogens can occur naturally or may be formulated in a 
laboratory. Natural hallucinogens include peyote and mescaline, 
while LSD and PCP are manufactured. These drugs act to alter the 
user's reality by distorting sensory input or generating false 
sensations. Users can see things that are not there, or see 
distorted images of things that are there. They may hallucinate 
sounds, touches, and other sensory data. Hallucinations 
constitute a complete break from reality, and eliminate the 
ability to anticipate, prepare, and react appropriately to the 
driving environment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Synergistic Effects of Multiple Drugs.</strong> 
<em>Synergism</em> comes from the Greek word <em>synergos</em>, meaning 
"to work together." It refers to the interaction of two or more 
chemicals to produce a combined effect that is more profound than the 
simple addition of the individual effects of those chemicals—a 
sort of "one plus one is greater than two" effect. When <em>any</em> 
two or more drugs are combined, they can create a level of 
intoxication that is greater than either drug is capable of on its own. 
Carefully read the warning labels on any medications you are taking, 
and heed those warnings. Be wary of mixing any combination of alcohol, 
drugs, and medication, whether you will be driving or not. The results 
are often unexpected and can be incredibly harmful to the body.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Synergism.jpg" alt="Syngergism">
<div class="caption" align="center">Use extreme caution when combining two or more drugs. <br>
You never know what results you might conjure up!</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Implied Consent.</strong> Simply by signing an original 
or renewal application for a driver license, persons give their 
implied consent to submit to any tests deemed necessary to determine 
the amount of intoxicating substances in their body upon the request 
of a law enforcement officer who has lawfully arrested them for 
driving under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs. <!--The 
consent is deemed <em>implied</em> because the authorization has 
already been given, and is not needed again at the time of arrest.--></p>

<ul>
<li>If arrested for DUI involving alcohol, the driver will 
be administered a test of the blood or breath to determine 
the amount of alcohol present in his or her body.</li>
<li>If stopped for DUI involving drugs or a combination of 
drugs and alcohol, the driver will be administered a test 
of the blood to identify the type and amount of controlled 
substances present in his or her body.</li>
<li>A chemical test of the driver's urine may be 
administered <em>only</em> if:</li>
<ul>
<li>both blood and breath tests are unavailable.</li>
<li>the person is a hemophiliac.</li>
<li>the person is taking anticoagulant medications.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not subsequently convicted of DUI, the driver's 
license will be suspended for one year for refusing to submit to, 
or for failing to complete, a lawfully requested chemical test. If 
a refusing driver was convicted for DUI within the previous 10 years, 
the person's vehicle may be impounded for 5 days (15 days for two or 
more convictions within the previous 10 years).</p>
<!--CVC 23612; CVC 13353, 13353.1-->

<p><strong>Alternatives to Driving Impaired.</strong> The best—and 
smartest—way to avoid a DUI is to never consume controlled 
substances before getting behind the wheel of a motor vehicle. If you 
insist on going out for a night on the town, consider these suggestions 
to stay safe:</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Hand_Over_Keys.jpg" alt="Hand Over Keys" style="padding-right:40">
<div class="caption">The best way to avoid DUI <br>
is to never consume controlled <br>
substances before driving.</div>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Have a designated driver accompany you.<!-- The designated 
driver program takes a positive approach to the very real 
problem of drinking and driving&mdash;and it's highly effective. 
The idea is that when two or more persons go to a place where 
alcohol may be consumed, one person serves as the designated 
sober driver. This driver must be over the age of 21, and must 
possess a valid driver license. Many restaurants support this 
program by offering free non-alcoholic drinks or other 
incentives to the patron who identifies him/herself as the 
designated driver (although, ultimately, management may refuse 
service to anyone at any time). After completely abstaining from 
the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicants, the designated 
driver is then responsible to make sure that all other members 
of the group arrive home safely. This allows several people to 
drink socially without the fear of being cited for DUI&mdash;and 
without injuring or killing someone.--></li>
<li>Use alternative methods of transportation (e.g., cab, bus, 
train). Do <em>not</em> ride a bicycle; it is considered a 
vehicle, and you can be stopped for DUI. Besides, it's 
dangerous!</li>
<li>Call a friend for a ride home.</li>
<li>Stay overnight at or near where you are consuming.</li>
<li>Engage in activities that do not involve alcohol or drugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol is a grave—if 
you'll excuse the pun—offense. When you drive under the influence, 
you deliberately compromise your mental and physical faculties, 
sometimes to the point of a total loss of control. And a loss of control 
behind the wheel can lead to all sorts of other losses: property, life, 
and health. You probably get the idea by now, but it always bears 
repeating: <strong>NEVER DRINK (OR USE OTHER DRUGS) AND DRIVE!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Alternatives.jpg" alt="Alternatives">
<div class="caption" align="center">The best defense against drinking and driving is to <br>
find activities that do not involve alcohol or drugs.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>How to Avoid Impaired Drivers.</strong> Law enforcement 
officers look for certain behaviors to help them identify impaired 
drivers. You can take a cue from them and watch for:</p>

<ul>
<li>wide turns or straddling lanes</li>
<li>driving with headlights off</li>
<li>weaving</li>
<li>tailgating</li>
<li>erratic braking</li>
<li>inconsistent use of turn signals</li>
<li>abrupt or illegal turns</li>
<li>slow responses</li>
<li>driving excessively slow or fast</li>
</ul>

<p>It is safer to be behind a drunk than in front of one. If you are 
following a driver whom you suspect of being intoxicated, do not try to 
pass. Slow down and try to put some distance between you and the other 
vehicle. You may want to consider taking down the license plate number 
and contacting the authorities if the driver's behavior is highly 
erratic.</p>

<p>If an impaired driver comes up behind you, try to find a safe "out." 
Signal and make the first available right turn as quickly and safely as 
possible. If no right turn is available, make the first available left 
turn that doesn't require you to wait for a gap in oncoming traffic. 
Once you can safely stop, wait for a minute or two before proceeding. 
Never try to outrun an impaired driver. And do not just pull to the 
side of the road and stop; impaired drivers have a tendency to follow 
lights, so they may follow you off of the road and forget to stop.</p>

<h4>Exterior Concerns</h4>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Equip_Checklist.jpg" alt="Equipment Checklist">
</div>

<p><strong>Vehicle Requirements</strong></p>

<p>The State of California has established certain equipment 
requirements for vehicles that are registered in the jurisdiction (as 
outlined later in this course, in the section "The Vehicle"). While it 
is mostly up to vehicle manufacturers to ensure that the vehicles they 
sell are appropriately outfitted, it is the responsibility of drivers 
to ensure that the vehicles are maintained to standards.</p>

<p><strong>Licensing, Registration, and Insurance</strong></p>

<p><strong>Driver Licensing.</strong> California residents who drive on 
public highways or in public parking facilities must have a California 
driver license (with exemptions for some military and government 
personnel, as well as other stipulations). If you move to or within 
California, you must apply for a license (or notify the DMV of your 
change of address) within 10 days. It is a misdemeanor to drive in 
California without a valid driver license. If you do, you can be cited, 
your vehicle may be impounded, and you may have to appear in court.</p>

<p>You will be denied a license if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>are not of the required age (at least 16 years for a 
provisional license)</li>
<li>have corrected vision that is worse than 20/200 (may not 
use telescopic lenses)</li>
<li>cannot pass the DMV's written or driving examinations</li>
<li>do not surrender a license from another jurisdiction</li>
<li>hold a license that has been suspended or revoked by any 
jurisdiction</li>
</ul>

<div class="caption" align="center">Driving is a privilege, not a right. <br>
Applicants may be denied a license <br>

</div>

<p>(Courts may not suspend, revoke, or restrict a driver, or order the 
DMV to delay licensure for a person convicted of prostitution or 
vandalism, a minor convicted of unlawful possession or use of a firearm, 
or offenses related to possession, purchase, sale, or transport of 
controlled substances involving the use of a vehicle. Courts also may 
not order the DMV to delay licensure, suspend, revoke, or restrict a 
person based upon a conviction of minor's possession/use of controlled 
substances or alcohol for specified violations.)</p>

Business and Professions Code) -->


<p>In addition to your obligation to obey traffic laws while behind the 
wheel, there are a few laws governing your use of the license itself. 
It is unlawful to:</p>

<ul>
<li>knowingly allow another person to use your driver license</li>
<li>present a license issued to someone else as your own</li>
<li>refuse to surrender a license that has been suspended, 
revoked, or cancelled</li>
<li>alter or reproduce a license in such a manner that it could 
be mistaken for a valid license</li>
</ul>

<p>As a condition of obtaining or renewing a driver's license, 
applicants must sign a declaration acknowledging that they may be 
charged with murder if a person is killed as a result of their driving 
under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, drivers may operate only those vehicles they have been 
licensed to drive. Different types of vehicles have different 
performance characteristics, and the safe operation of various types 
of vehicles therefore requires widely varying skill sets. The State 
recognizes this fact and issues licenses in numerous classes.</p>

</div><br>

<p>The State takes great pains to make traffic safety a priority. This 
starts with minimum age requirements and the extensive testing of new 
license applicants. Even so, teen drivers have conviction, collision, 
and injury rates much higher than those of older drivers. This has led 
to the implementation of a graduated driver license system, by which 
drivers are slowly granted more privileges as they gain experience 
behind the wheel. For complete information on the licensing of new 
drivers and the restrictions placed on them, contact the DMV.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle Licensing and Registration.</strong> When you 
purchase a new or used vehicle from a licensed California dealer, the 
dealer collects a use tax and fees to register and title the vehicle. 
The dealer submits these fees and documents to the DMV and supplies you 
with a temporary registration. Within a few weeks after you purchase 
your vehicle, you will receive in the mail a registration card, license 
plates, stickers, and a Certificate of Title (if appropriate).</p>

<p>If you obtain or purchase a vehicle from a private party, you must 
register the change of ownership with the DMV within 10 days. You must 
submit to the DMV:</p>

<ul>
<li>a properly completed and signed Certificate of Title</li>
<li>smog certification provided by the seller (if required)</li>
<li>use tax payment (if required)</li>
<li>an Odometer Mileage Disclosure Statement, if applicable</li>
<li>appropriate DMV fees</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Paperwork.jpg" alt="Paperwork">
<div class="caption">If you sell or purchase a <br>
vehicle in California, you'll <br>
need to register it with <br>
the DMV.</div>
</div>

<p>When you sell or transfer a vehicle, you must report the action to 
the DMV within 5 days by completing a Notice of Transfer and Release of 
Liability form.</p>

<p>Vehicles registered in another state or foreign country must be 
registered in California within 20 days after the owner becomes a 
resident or gets a job (with exemptions for nonresident military 
personnel and their spouses.) The paperwork needed to register an 
out-of-state vehicle are:</p>

<ul>
<li>a properly completed and signed Application for Title or 
Registration</li>
<li>verification of the vehicle, completed by the DMV, law 
enforcement agent, or an auto club employee</li>
<li>an out-of-state title and/or last issued out-of-state 
registration card, if the title is not submitted</li>
<li>smog certification (1976 and newer motor vehicles only)</li>
<li>weight certificate (for commercial vehicles only)</li>
<li>use tax payment (if required)</li>
<li>an Odometer Mileage Disclosure Statement, if applicable</li>
<li>appropriate DMV fees</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have any questions about vehicle 
registration, contact the Department of Motor Vehicles!</p>

<p><strong>Liability Insurance.</strong> As a driver, you are required 
to be financially responsible for your actions whenever you drive and 
for all motor vehicles that you own. The options for demonstrating 
financial responsibility include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Insurance:</strong> If you own 25 or more 
vehicles with a combined total value of at least $575,000 and 
have had your books audited for the last three years, you may 
be able to claim <em>self-insured</em> status. Chances are 
that this is not the case if you are an individual (unless 
you're Jay Leno), but a  lot of vehicle dealerships use this 
option.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Deposit:</strong> If you have a spare 
$35,000 laying around the house, you can meet your financial 
responsibility requirement by depositing that money into a 
bank account for the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). It 
can be <em>any</em> bank account, so long as the funds are 
held exclusively for the DMV.</li>
<li><strong>Bond:</strong> Most trucking companies carry bonds 
of a million dollars or more on their trucks and the loads 
they haul. Individuals can also opt for a bond; but, despite 
the relatively low requirement of the bond ($35,000), it's 
probably not the most affordable option for individuals.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Insurance_Salesman.jpg" alt="Insurance Salesman">
</div>

<p><em>Most</em> folks demonstrate financial responsibility by 
purchasing an insurance policy. The minimum insurance coverage required 
in California is referred to by the insurance industry as "15/30/5":</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>$15,000</strong> for a single death or injury</li>
<li><strong>$30,000</strong> for death or injury to more than 
one person in a given incident</li>
<li><strong>$5,000</strong> for property damage</li>
</ul>

<p>You must carry evidence of financial responsibility whenever you 
drive, and you must show it to a peace officer upon request. Failure to 
do so will get you a fine and may, at the discretion of the court, get 
your vehicle impounded. Drivers who fail to provide evidence of 
financial responsibility after being involved in a collision may further 
face suspension of their driver license. The person's driving privileges 
will not be reinstated for a period of one year and until the person 
files proof of financial responsibility; the suspension will be 
reinstated if the person fails to maintain proof of financial 
responsibility for three years. (A person who pays a penalty fee of $250 
and files proof of financial responsibility may be allowed to drive 
during their suspension period for purposes of employment and to 
transport a minor dependent to school, with the school superintendent's 
written certification of need.)</p>

<p>Drivers who provide false evidence of financial responsibility may be 
found guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $750 
and/or jail time not to exceed 30 days. They will also have their 
driver's license suspended for one year from the date of conviction.</p>

<p><strong>Conditions Beyond Driving Ability</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, environmental conditions can make driving 
difficult—even downright dangerous! Driving in inclement weather, 
if the conditions are severe enough, can present a problem to anyone. 
But there are other times when conditions might be beyond the abilities 
of a specific driver at a specific moment. For instance, a self-limiting 
strategy commonly employed by older drivers is to take alternate routes 
to avoid crowded thoroughfares, particularly during times of especially 
heavy traffic. In the interest of safety, all drivers should have a 
willingness to modify their travel plans—whatever the confounding 
reason—until conditions are within the driver's ability to handle 
them.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Communicating with other users of the roadway is key to defensive 
driving. Few things more effectively prevent collisions than drivers 
who are aware of others in the environment and forewarned of their 
intentions. Fortunately, there are a variety of tools that drivers 
can use to communicate their intentions to other users of the 
roadway:</p>

<div id="blinker_container" class="img_r" style="width: 288px;">
<div class="caption" style="padding-left:15px">Signal lights are an extremely useful <br>
means for communicating with others.<br><br>

To signal a right turn, position your <br>
mouse pointer to the right of the vehicle. <br>
To signal a left turn, position your <br>
mouse pointer to the left of the vehicle. <br>
To "apply the brakes," place your mouse <br>
pointer toward the rear of the vehicle.
<br><br></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
function swap(src){
img = document.getElementById('blinker_car');
img.src = 'ca/images/chapters_tsc/Blinker_Animation/Blinker_' + src + '.gif';
}
</script>
<a href="#" onclick="swap('Explode');"><img style="border:none;" id="blinker_car" src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Blinker_Animation/Blinker_Off.gif" usemap="#blinker"></a>
<map name="blinker">
<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,144,180" onmouseover="swap('Left');" onmouseout="swap('Off');" alt="Left Blinker">
<area shape="rect" coords="144,0,288,180" onmouseover="swap('Right');" onmouseout="swap('Off');" alt="Right Blinker">
<area shape="rect" coords="0,180,288,361" onmouseover="swap('Stop');" onmouseout="swap('Off');" alt="Brake Lights">
</map>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lights and Signals:</strong> The most obvious way 
to employ these resources is to use them as intended. For 
instance, you might use your turn signals to indicate a desire 
to turn, or use your emergency flashers to warn others that you 
are in trouble and/or immobilized. You might also attempt to 
warn off a tailgater by tapping your brakes to flash your brake 
lights (but resist the temptation to brake hard to "scare" the 
following driver, as this may result in a rear-end collision!). 
Or, you might flash your headlights to acknowledge another 
vehicle's presence. Just remember that some of these measures 
(e.g., flashing your lights) are ambiguous and should be used 
sparingly. Sensitize yourself to what effectively communicates 
information to other drivers, and what might be confusing.</li>
<li><strong>Horn:</strong> As with any tool, your horn is most 
effective when employed properly. Your horn should be used only 
to give an audible warning when reasonably necessary to ensure 
the safe operation of your vehicle. <!--(CVC 27001) -->You may 
use it to warn other drivers and pedestrians who stray into 
your line of travel, for instance. For such purposes, a few 
short beeps are actually more effective than a long blast, 
which tends to either blend into the background noise or scare 
the living daylights out of the other party—neither of 
which is particularly helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Signals:</strong> Drivers are required to use 
hand-and-arm signals, from the left side of the vehicle, to 
indicate turns and slowing/stopping when electric signals are 
missing or malfunctioning. These signals might also be used to 
enhance safety when electric signals may be difficult to see 
(e.g., because of bright sunlight).</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left Turn:</strong> Left hand and arm extended 
horizontally beyond the side of the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Right Turn:</strong> Left hand and arm 
extended upward beyond the side of the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Slow or Stop:</strong> Left hand and arm 
extended downward beyond the side of the vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<!--CVC 22110 - 22111-->
<li><strong>Eye Contact:</strong> Use eye contact to acknowledge 
the presence of other users of the roadway and to make sure that 
the other person has seen you.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Communication is most effective when it 
is based on courtesy. Always be polite when you communicate with other 
drivers!</p>

<h3>Courtesy</h3>

<p>A misconception commonly shared by drivers—both new motorists 
and those who have become habituated to driving—is that they 
are alone when they are in their vehicles. Individual drivers sit 
comfortably behind metal and glass in climate controlled vehicles 
with the latest high-tech entertainment systems. Under such conditions, 
it's easy to feel isolated…in your own little world. Such a 
feeling is at the heart of a lot of bad driving behaviors. It is a 
worldview that sees other users of the roadway as an intrusion. But the 
fact of the matter is that you share the road with other drivers, the 
operators of all sorts of vehicles, and pedestrians. In short, driving 
is a <em>social</em> activity.</p>

<div class="img_l">

<p>You wouldn't scream hysterically and make offensive gestures at a 
co-worker who came around a blind corner and nearly ran into you, would 
you? You wouldn't go to a restaurant and run full speed through the 
place, pushing and shoving, trying to find a table, would you? For 
the sake of your co-workers and fellow diners, we certainly hope you 
wouldn't! In these sorts of situations, you're likely to be polite 
and courteous with everyone you encounter. Yet, the rude behaviors 
described above are exactly the type of actions that many drivers 
engage in when they get behind the wheel. Because of the social nature 
of the driving environment, however, drivers should be as courteous 
while driving as they are in other social contexts—like the 
workplace, a restaurant, or a party.</p>

<p>Courtesy is an attitude of cooperation and politeness toward other 
users of the roadway. The first—and most important—thing 
that courtesy does is to stop a difficult situation from turning into 
an angry confrontation. Such a scene is bad for everyone. And, in the 
service of self-interest, courtesy can improve your situation by 
helping to sort out the problem more quickly. If traffic is slowed 
by drivers attempting to merge into your lane, for instance, allowing 
another driver to merge smoothly and easily into the space in front 
of you will ultimately get things moving more efficiently. Being 
courteous, it turns out, is always a win-win proposition!</p>

<h3>Knowing and Applying the Rules of the Road</h3>

<p>No one expects drivers to know every section of the California 
Vehicle Code by heart. There are portions detailing all sorts of 
vehicle-related regulations, many of which are not pertinent to the 
everyday operation of a motor vehicle. All drivers <em>are</em> 
responsible, however, for knowing and correctly applying the basic 
rules of the road that will allow safe interaction with others on 
a daily basis. For the most part, everyday driving regulations are 
basic and make sense, and drivers should always obey the literal 
interpretation of those laws. Perhaps some of these regulations 
have slipped your mind, but hopefully this course will help to 
refresh your memory.</p>

<h3>Identifying and Responding to Hazards</h3>

<p>Drivers are in control of heavy machinery. As such, they are 
responsible for identifying hazards in the roadway and responding 
appropriately. We'll discuss some specific techniques later in this 
course. But defensive drivers, who are adept at identifying and 
responding to hazards, generally look ahead in traffic, take in the 
entire scene, and anticipate where problems might occur. By doing so, 
they can formulate tentative response strategies and be in a position 
to easily implement those plans should the need arise. In this way, 
they can help to keep everyone in the driving environment safe.</p>

<h3>Young Passengers</h3>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Big_Baby.jpg" alt="Big Baby">
<div class="caption">Drivers need to watch out <br>
for children...and those who <br>
act like them.</div>
</div>

<p>Children in general, but especially those at very young ages, may 
lack the experience or intellectual capacity to appreciate the sheer 
power that automobiles possess. They don't take care, so <em>you</em> 
must! Drivers are responsible for protecting young children from the 
dangers that motor vehicles can present.</p>

<h4>Check Around the Vehicle Before Entering</h4>

<p>Drivers should check around the vehicle before climbing behind 
the wheel. Children often play around vehicles, and adults may not be 
aware of their presence. It's especially difficult when children are 
on the ground or under the vehicle—exactly those areas where 
they will remain undetected without some effort by the driver. To 
avoid needless tragedy, check around the vehicle to ensure that all 
is clear before you start out.</p>

<h4>Unattended Children</h4>

<p>Children, like <em>all</em> passengers, should always be properly 
restrained when traveling in a motor vehicle. This is likely to save 
them in a crash, of course, but it can have other benefits as well. 
Curious, probing hands could release the brake or shift the 
transmission into neutral when a child is left alone in a vehicle. 
Children who are properly restrained, however, will not have access to 
vehicle controls, and will be unable to cause unintentional harm.</p>

<p>Children should <em>never</em> be left in a vehicle on a hot 
day—whether accidentally, or consciously and negligently while 
their parents run errands. While anyone can experience a memory lapse 
and forget a child (it's the most common reason children are left 
behind), that little slip could be deadly. Vehicles heat up quickly 
on a hot day, and a child might die of hyperthermia in just minutes! 
Meanwhile, those who knowingly leave their children alone are inviting 
tragedy.</p>

<p>These tips will help you to avoid a hot-vehicle mishap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Place your cell phone, purse/briefcase, etc., on the floor 
of the vehicle's rear seating area. When you retrieve them at 
the end of your trip, you'll notice your child as well.</li>
<li>Seat the younger (or quieter) child behind the front 
passenger seat, where he or she is most likely to catch your 
eye.</li>
<li>Keep a teddy bear or other stuffed animal in the car seat 
when it's empty. When you put your child in the seat, move the 
toy to the front passenger seat as a reminder.</li>
<li>Make a habit of always opening the back door of your 
vehicle after you park to make sure there's no child back 
there.</li>
<li>Ask your child's babysitter or day care provider to 
always phone you promptly if your child isn't dropped off as 
scheduled.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Kaitlyn's Law" prohibits parents or guardians from leaving a child 
6 years of age or younger inside a vehicle, without the supervision of 
a person 12 years of age or older, while the engine is running and/or 
while the keys are in the ignition, or when conditions inside the vehicle 
might present a significant risk to the child's health or safety.</p>

<h3>Poor Driving Conditions</h3>

<p>When the weather gets nasty the roadway becomes a different and 
more dangerous place. Driving conditions change constantly, and the 
defensive driver is responsible to change with them. It helps to 
check local weather conditions before setting out: call the state 
patrol hotline, monitor local radio stations, or check Internet sites. 
These days you can get real-time weather and road conditions for just 
about anywhere. Do not drive into hazardous weather conditions when 
you can avoid them; start your trip earlier or later.</p>

<p>Remember also that posted speed limits are determined by traffic 
engineers based on ideal conditions. Since bad weather creates 
conditions that are less than ideal, you'll need to slow down and 
adapt your driving habits to stay safe.</p>

<h4>Fog</h4>

<p>The air all around us contains water vapor. When the ambient 
temperature drops below a certain level, the water vapor condenses 
into droplets so tiny that they are light enough to remain suspended in 
the air. These suspended droplets of water accumulate, and eventually 
become a cloud that drifts along at ground level. It is no different 
than a cloud in the sky; but when this cloud is at ground level, it is 
known as <em>fog</em>.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Foggy.jpg" alt="Foggy">
</div>

<p>Fog is moisture, which is a natural reflector of light. Fog makes 
it difficult to see because it does not allow the clean transmission 
of the information carried by light to our eyes. In other words, you 
can't see through it. It's also hazardous because it can reflect the 
light of your headlights and create a visual barrier all around your 
vehicle. The diminished ability to rely on visual references can lead 
to disorientation; you can feel as if you are floating weightless in 
space. When driving in fog, anticipate that you will have problems 
seeing at all distances, and expect that others will have difficulty 
seeing you. Worse still, fog can condense on road surfaces, making 
them damp and slick. This can make it dangerous to maneuver around 
those hazards that fog obscures until the last minute.</p>

<p>When driving in fog, remember these tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Activate your headlights on the <em>low beam</em> setting 
when you drive in fog. High beam headlights can reflect off of 
the tiny water droplets and shine back into your eyes, turning 
the fog into a solid white shroud. Better still, use fog 
lights—in conjunction with your low beam 
headlights—if your vehicle is equipped with them.</li>
<li>Control your speed. When you enter a fog bank, slow down 
enough so that you will be able to bring your vehicle to a 
stop within the distance you are able to see. You can work 
your way back up as conditions allow. Keep plenty of space 
between your vehicle and others to avoid hazards.</li>
<li>Keep your defroster and windshield wipers in good working 
order. You'll need them to clear your windows when moisture 
condenses on the glass.</li>
<li>Listen for traffic that you cannot see.</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid passing other vehicles in the fog. Since visibility is limited, 
you can never be certain that it's safe. Watch carefully for other 
vehicles stopped on the roadside. If the fog becomes so thick that you 
can barely see, pull <em>completely</em> off the road until the fog 
clears enough to allow you to see again. Turn off your lights and keep 
your foot off of the brake pedal so another driver doesn't see your 
taillights, think you are moving, and drive into the back of your 
vehicle.</p>

<h4>Rain</h4>

<p>It is not uncommon for motorists to miscalculate their traction needs 
and other considerations on wet surfaces. Rain compromises your stopping 
power and steering; and, like fog, it cuts visibility. The situation can 
get even worse if strong winds are pushing your vehicle around. Luckily, 
a few simple tips can keep you safe and on-course in the dampest of 
conditions.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Wiper_Blade.jpg" alt="Wiper Blade">
</div>

<p><strong>Visibility.</strong> Windshield wipers clear rain spattered 
windows so you can see where you're going—but only if they're in 
good condition. Wipe the blades off every couple of weeks with a rag 
dipped in windshield-washer fluid to remove dirt and oxidized rubber. 
Wiper blades should be replaced whenever they fail to cleanly sweep 
water from the windshield, and will rarely be effective after more than 
a year or so. Activating your defroster can help to remove moisture from 
the <em>inside</em> of the windshield.</p>

<p>Making sure that your windshield, lights, and mirrors are clean 
helps you to maintain good visibility as well. You may be tempted to 
allow rain to wash them clean. If the rain is heavy enough, it will 
do the job…eventually. If the rain is light, or in the first 
few minutes after it begins to rain, however, the rainwater can mix 
with the residue on your windshield to create a gunky, smeary mess.</p>

<p>You can also aid your ability to see and be seen by turning on your 
headlights. The law requires drivers to activate their lights whenever 
weather conditions reduce visibility to below 1,000 feet. Remember to 
use your <em>low beam</em> headlights in the rain. Like fog, rain will 
reflect high beam headlights back into your eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Traction.</strong> Traction is always compromised in the 
rain, but the worst time is during the first thirty minutes of rain 
after a long drought. During the dry spell, oil and dirt build up on 
the roadway. Rain loosens these substances and mixes with them to 
form a slick mess on the road surface. Until this mess is washed to 
the side of the road, it can be very slippery.</p>

<p>When weather makes the road slippery, keep your pace down to a safe 
speed. Even under the best of rainy conditions, stopping distances 
will increase thanks to the loss of traction. Allow yourself two or 
three times the normal stopping distance by decreasing your speed and 
enlarging the space around your vehicle. Cutting your speed will also 
help you to avoid <em>hydroplaning</em> (a dangerous phenomenon in 
which your tires "ski" on a thin film of water, causing you to lose 
control).</p>

<p><strong>Submerged Dangers.</strong> Try to avoid driving through 
water that has collected in potholes and other depressions in the 
roadway. You can never be sure how deep the depression is, or what 
lurks beneath its surface. You can break an axle by driving into a 
vicious pothole, or completely disable your vehicle by going through 
unexpectedly deep water.</p>

<p>If you absolutely <em>must</em> drive through deep and/or moving 
water, proceed very cautiously. You might be surprised by the 
tremendous force possessed by rushing water. Evenly distributing 
cargo weight can help you to maintain control over the vehicle, and 
shifting into a lower gear helps to ensure that the vehicle has the 
driving power to get through the water. After emerging from the water, 
be sure to test your brakes to make sure they will stop the vehicle. 
You can dry wet brakes by applying light pressure to the brake pedal 
("riding the brake") for several seconds as you continue to drive.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Porsche-Snow.jpg" alt="Porsche in Snow">
</div>

<h4>Snow and Ice</h4>

<p>Snowy conditions reduce your ability to see and make it difficult 
for others to see you. Remove snow and ice from your windows and lights 
before departing, and make sure your windshield wipers (including the 
washer fluid) and defroster are well maintained. Kick snow from your 
footwear so your foot doesn't slip off of the pedals while you're 
driving. Activate your <em>low beam</em> headlights.</p>

<p>If you venture out during or shortly after a snowstorm, you may come 
across snow removal equipment. Snowplows are ultimately your friends, 
but they can be dangerous to encounter. Give plows and sanding trucks 
a wide berth, especially when they are working and have their flashing 
warning lights on. Keep clear of the plume of plowed snow, as it can 
create "whiteout" conditions that leave a driver blind. Finally, don't 
assume that plowed roads will afford good traction.</p>

<p>Carry a winter survival kit in your vehicle that includes warm 

clothing/blankets, a shovel, a flashlight, matches and candles, and 
high-energy foods. If your vehicle becomes stranded in a snowstorm, 
<em>stay with the vehicle</em>! Most deaths occur when motorists 
wander away from their vehicle and get lost. Run the vehicle and 
heater for only short periods as needed. When doing so, crack the 
windows and do your best to make sure that the tailpipe is clear of 
obstructions in order to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Tire_Chains.jpg" alt="Tire Chains">
<div class="caption">Use tire chains as necessary to enhance <br>
traction in snowy weather.</div>
</div>

<p>Packed snow and/or ice create slippery road surfaces. You can put 
snow tires or tire chains on your vehicle to increase traction. Even 
so, you should create more space between your vehicle and others in 
these conditions. Accelerate, steer, and brake gently. Above all, 
slow down!</p>

<p><strong>Ice.</strong> Snow tends to collect and remain in sheltered 
and shaded areas, where it can freeze and refreeze. Also, watch for ice 
around bridges (where water tends to freeze more readily than on other 
road surfaces), ramps, and tunnels. Often, the biggest problem with ice 
is knowing that it's there. Drivers may assume that a road that looks 
slick is merely covered with water and not ice. A defensive driver 
knows that it really doesn't matter, as both conditions are 
slippery—and hazardous. Play it safe: slow down, and brake and 
steer smoothly and gradually.</p>

<p><strong>Starting from a Stop when Traction Is Poor.</strong> 
Traction is the key to getting your vehicle rolling, and there are 
several ways to improve traction. The obvious one is to have tires 
with sufficient tread. You can increase traction by adding weight 
(sandbags or concrete blocks, for instance) over the drive wheels. 
Throwing sand or another friction enhancing material under the drive 
wheels can also help. Finally, try starting in a higher gear to reduce 
the amount of torque being delivered to the drive wheels. Accelerate 
smoothly and gradually.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Guitarist.jpg" alt="Guitarist">
<div class="caption">This sort of rocking out <br>
might be fun, but it's not <br>
going to help your vehicle <br>
escape a rut!</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Rocking Out.</strong> If you're stuck in a 
rut—literally, not psychologically—there is a technique to 
help you get out. It entails rocking your vehicle back and forth, often 
with the help of friends outside of the vehicle, in order to build up 
enough momentum to get out.</p>

<p>If help is available, position your assistants at either end of the 
vehicle. They can push the vehicle as you gently accelerate. As your 
forward progress is about to stop, release the accelerator and allow 
the vehicle to fall back into the rut. At the lowest point, accelerate 
gently in reverse; allow the vehicle to fall back into the rut as your 
rearward progress is about to stop. Repeat these steps until adequate 
momentum is built up and you can drive out of the snow or mud.</p>

<h3>Rights and Duties</h3>

<p>Driving is a social activity, and all users of the roadway have a 
responsibility to keep each other safe. Therefore, each group of users 
has certain rights and duties with regard to others.</p>

<h4>Bicycle Safety</h4>

<p>Bicycles are subject to the same rules of the road as motor vehicles. 
They have all of the rights of motor vehicle operators, as well as all 
of the obligations. Bicycles may travel in the same lanes as motor 
vehicles so long as they do not impede the flow of traffic, however 
cyclists should confine themselves to bicycle lanes or the right edge 
of the road (except when preparing for a left turn) if they cannot keep 
up with traffic. Bicyclists are allowed to travel straight through an 
intersection from a left- or right-turn-only lane, so long as an official 
traffic control device indicates that the movement is permitted.</p>
<!-- CVC 21200, 21202; CVC 22101 -->

<p>Drivers may make use of designated bicycle lanes when turning right. 
Motorists may not enter a bike lane more than 200 feet before their 
intended turn, however, and they must yield the right-of-way to 
cyclists who are already in the lane.</p>
<!-- CVC 21209 -->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Bicyclist.jpg" alt="Bicyclist">
</div>

<p>Always slow down as you approach a cyclist, and allow plenty of 
room when passing—<em>at least</em> three feet between your 
vehicle and the overtaken bicycle or its operator. When a three-foot 
space cushion is not possible because of traffic or roadway conditions, 
drivers are to slow to a reasonable and prudent speed and pass only 
when doing so would not endanger the safety of the cyclist.</p>
<!-- CVC 21760 -->

<p>Be courteous and patient—especially with younger riders who 
may not know or obey traffic rules. The most common motorist-caused 
collisions between a motor vehicle and a bicycle occur when a driver 
fails to yield to a cyclist when turning or after stopping at a stop 
sign. This is usually because drivers overlook bicycles when they scan 
the driving environment, or because they misjudge a cyclist's speed. 
Always signal and check your mirrors and blind spot when changing 
directions, but especially when turning right; yield the right-of-way 
to cyclists as necessary.</p>

<p>Under California law, a bicycle ridden at night must be equipped 
with a white light that shines to the front of the bike and is visible 
from at least 300 feet to the front and the sides. A cyclist is to 
have on each pedal/shoe/ankle a white or yellow reflector that is 
visible from the front and rear for at least 200 feet. Except for 
bicycles with reflectorized tires, there must also be a white or 
yellow reflector mounted front of center on each side of the bike, 
and a red reflector mounted rear of center on each side of the bike. 
Finally, bicycles are required to have a red reflector, or a solid 
or flashing red light with a built-in reflector, that is visible 
from a distance of 500 feet to the rear when illuminated by high 
beam headlamps.</p>

<p>Operators of bicycles ridden on a highway are required to ride 
upon a permanent, regular seat, unless the bicycle was designed by the 
manufacturer to be ridden without. All bicycle passengers must ride on 
a permanent, regular seat; and passengers 4 years of age or less, or 
who weigh 40 pounds or less, must be in a bicycle child safety seat. 
Bicyclists under the age of 18 are required to wear an approved safety 
helmet. Helmets and other safety equipment, such as shoes, gloves, 
reflective clothing, and elbow- and knee pads are always highly 
encouraged. It is unlawful for any person to ride a bicycle upon a 
highway while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or other 
drug.</p>

<p><strong>Electric Bicycles</strong></p>

<p>An <em>electric bicycle</em> (e-bike) is defined as a bicycle with 
fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts. 
Electric bicycles are classified based on their maximum motor speed and 
level of electric assist:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Class 1 e-bikes</strong> are bicycles equipped with 
a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, 
and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches 
the speed of 20 mph. An approved bike helmet is required for 
operators under the age of 18.</li>
<li><strong>Class 2 e-bikes</strong> are bicycles equipped with 
a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle, and 
that is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle 
reaches the speed of 20 mph. An approved bike helmet is required 
for operators under the age of 18.</li>
<li><strong>Class 3 e-bikes</strong> are bicycles equipped with 
a speedometer and with a motor that provides assistance only when 
the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when 
the bicycle reaches the speed of 28 mph. Operators must be at 
least 16 years of age and are required to wear an approved bike 
helmet.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Cyclist.jpg" alt="Cyclist">
</div>

<p>Electric bicycles may not be tampered with or modified so as to 
change their speed capability unless the classification label is also 
changed.</p>
<!-- CVC 312.5; 21213; 24016 (d) -->

<p>Class 1 and 2 e-bikes may use bike paths or trails, unless specifically 
prohibited; class 3 e-bikes may not use bike paths or trails unless 
expressly authorized by local governments. Operators of e-bikes are not 
required to have or maintain a driver license, vehicle registration, 
license plates, or financial responsibility; however, e-bikes must follow 
the same regulations governing standard bicycles, including traffic laws, 
equipment requirements, and biking-under-the-influence laws.</p>
<!-- CVC 21207.5; 24016 -->

<p><strong>Electric Skateboards</strong></p>

<p>An <em>electrically motorized board</em> (electric skateboard) is 
any wheeled device that has a floorboard designed to be stood upon when 
riding that is not greater than 60 inches deep and 18 inches wide, is 
designed to transport only one person, and has an electric propulsion 
system averaging less than 1,000 watts that is capable of propelling 
the device on a paved level surface at no more than 20 mph. (The device 
may be designed to also be powered by human propulsion.)</p>
<!-- CVC 313.5 -->

<p>Electric skateboards may be operated only by a person who is at 
least 16 years of age and they may not be operated on a highway, 
bikeway, public bike path, sidewalk, or trail, unless the person is 
wearing an approved bicycle helmet. An electric skateboard operated on 
a highway during darkness must have (or the operator must be wearing) 
equipment to enhance visibility: a lamp emitting white light that is 
visible from a distance of 300 feet to the front, a red reflector or 
reflectorized material visible from a distance of 500 feet to the rear 
when directly in front of the upper beams of the headlamps of a motor 
vehicle, and a white or yellow reflector or reflectorized material 
visible from a distance of 200 feet to the sides.</p>
<!-- CVC 21291 - 21293 -->

<p>Electrically motorized boards may only be used on a highway with a 
speed limit of 35 mph, unless the board is operated entirely within a 
Class II (striped bike lane) or Class IV (physically separated lane) 
bikeway. Speeds on highways, bikeways, public bike paths, sidewalks, 
and trails are restricted to a maximum of 15 mph; nor may a person 
operate a motorized board at a speed greater than is reasonable or 
prudent for existing conditions or at a speed that endangers the safety 
of any person or property. Local authorities may enact further 
regulations restricting use. It is also illegal to operate an 
electrically motorized board on a highway while under the influence 
of alcohol or other drugs; a conviction for violating this law is 
punishable by a fine of up $250.</p>

<h4>Motorcycle Safety</h4>

<p>Like bicycles, motorcycles are often overlooked by drivers. Their 
smaller size makes them hard to see in the first place, and it makes 
it difficult to accurately judge their distance and speed. Quick 
acceleration and the need to frequently adjust lane position also 
make motorcycles challenging to track. But because most 
automobile-motorcycle crashes are caused by a motorist's failure 
to detect a motorcycle in traffic, it's easy to see why greater 
vigilance is vital.</p>

<p>Drivers must actively look for motorcycles. Check your mirrors 
frequently, and don't allow yourself to be surprised by a motorcycle 
driving between lanes of slow or stopped traffic ("splitting lanes"). 
Be sure to check your blind spot when changing lanes or turning, and 
watch for oncoming motorcycles when completing a left turn at 
intersections. Increase your space cushion around motorcycles, and 
never pass or drive alongside a motorcycle in the same lane. Take 
special care to never tailgate a motorcyclist, as motorcycles have 
much shorter stopping distances than passenger vehicles. Furthermore, 
you'll want to have time to stop in the event the biker falls.</p>

<p>For their part, motorcyclists may share a lane with one another; 
they are strongly discouraged from riding more than two abreast, 
however, as doing so would limit the ability of the center rider(s) 
to maneuver in an emergency situation. Motorcycle operators must be 
able to reach the ground with their feet, and handlebar grips may not 
be positioned more than six inches above the operator's shoulders, when 
the operator is sitting astride the seat. Motorcycle passengers must 
ride on a securely fastened seat with footrests, or in a sidecar 
designed to carry a passenger. The law also requires everyone riding 
on a motorcycle to wear a properly fitted, approved safety helmet, but 
smart bikers don't stop there. Goggles or face shields provide added 
protection. Leather jackets, pants, gloves, and boots keep them warm 
and dry, and can help to prevent serious injury in the event of a 
collision or fall. Bright-colored clothing is better than darker 
colors: fluorescent clothing is best for daytime riding, while 
reflective gear should be worn at night.</p>

<p>The law requires motorcycles to have at least one and not more than two 
headlamps, and motorcycles manufactured on or after January 1, 1978, must 
have headlamps that activate automatically whenever the motor is running. 
Motorcycles must also have one or more taillamps that are red in color and 
plainly visible from all distances within 1,000 feet to the rear (500 feet 
if the motorcycle was manufactured on or before January 1, 1969).</p>

<p>The <strong>California Motorcyclist Safety Program (CMSP)</strong> 
is California's official motorcycle safety and training program. CMSP 
offers the Basic RiderCourse for beginning riders of all ages. However, 
motorcyclists under 21 years of age are required to complete an approved 
novice course before they may apply for a permit, and must hold a permit 
for 6 months before a motorcycle license can be issued. A Basic RiderCourse 
provides five hours of classroom instruction and ten hours of practical 
riding exercises in a controlled, off-street environment (motorcycles and 
helmets are provided free of charge for use during the course). Successful 
completion of the course may waive the riding skills test requirement at 
the DMV (new cyclists must still pass the written exam prior to receiving 
their motorcycle endorsement). The Experienced RiderCourse offers advanced 
techniques to motorcyclists who are interested in improving their skills, 
and these half-day courses may qualify graduates for an insurance premium 
discount. Contact CMSP at 1-877-RIDE-411 for more information, or browse

<div class="caption">Watch for tail swing when oversized <br>
vehicles turn. And never try to <br>
squeeze between an oversized <br>
vehicle and the curb.</div>
</div>

<h4>Oversized Vehicles</h4>

<p>Drivers of oversized vehicles have large blind spots directly in 
front, to the rear, and to the sides. You'll want to give them plenty 
of space so they don't unwittingly run you over. Oversized vehicles 
also present a hazard—especially near intersections—because 
they may inhibit your view of oncoming and cross traffic. Stay well 
back from large vehicles so that you can see everything you need to see 
in order to drive safely. Remember that defensive driving entails both 
seeing and being seen.</p>

<p>Beware also of oversized vehicles turning in front of you. Oversized 
vehicles can experience what is called <em>tail swing</em>. This means 
that the rear of the turning vehicle travels to the outside of the 
turning radius. Sometimes this action can cause the rear of the vehicle 
to swing out several feet into the adjacent lane. Do not try to pass as 
an oversized vehicle is making its turn, or you could find yourself 
unexpectedly rear-ending it.</p>

<h2>The Rights and Responsibilities <br>
of a Pedestrian</h2>

<p>Pedestrians are such a special case that we discuss them in a 
dedicated section within this course. They are different from other 
users of the roadway in that they rely (almost) exclusively on their 
own power for propulsion, and they are small and lack the protection 
of a vehicle body and frame surrounding them. Their own vigilance and 
caution aside, they are dependent upon the operators of motor vehicles 
for their safety.</p>

<p>A <em>pedestrian</em> is a person on foot. Those who use roller 
skates, skateboards, etc., (but not bicycles) are also considered 
pedestrians. As well, a pedestrian can be a person with a disability 
who uses a wheelchair or other wheeled conveyance to get around.</p>
<!-- CVC 467 -->



<p>Pedestrians should be surrendered the right-of-way whenever possible. 
A driver is not expected to be able to stop when someone dashes into 
the street directly in front of the vehicle, of course. But defensive 
driving is ultimately about promoting safety. When a driver crosses 
paths with a pedestrian—especially when the driver is unsure of 
the pedestrian's intentions—the safest thing is for the driver to 
simply yield the right-of-way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Drivers are required to yield the right-of-way to a 
pedestrian within any marked crosswalk or within any unmarked 
crosswalk at an intersection.</li>
<!-- CVC 21950(a), (c) -->
<li>While pedestrians will <em>ideally</em> cross the street 
at intersections—in a marked crosswalk if there is 
one—they often don't. As a driver, you should anticipate 
pedestrians crossing streets in the middle of the block. 
Anticipate them crossing at intersections against the traffic 
controls. Anticipate them stepping into the street from between 
parked vehicles (or out of other areas with an obstructed 
view). Pedestrians <em>should</em> yield to vehicle traffic 
in these scenarios, but drivers need to remain alert and 
careful.</li>
<!-- CVC 21950(b), 21954 -->
<li>Whenever a vehicle has stopped at a crosswalk to allow a 
pedestrian to cross, drivers of other vehicles approaching from 
the rear may not overtake and pass the stopped vehicle.</li>
<!-- CVC 21951 -->
<li>Before driving on or across a sidewalk, motorists are to 
yield the right-of-way to approaching pedestrians. Vehicles 
may never block a marked or unmarked crosswalk or sidewalk.</li>
<!-- CVC 21952, 21970 -->
<li>Drivers should remain patient and allow older pedestrians, 
disabled pedestrians, and pedestrians with young children 
sufficient time to cross safely.</li>
<!-- 2013DH, p. 24 -->
<li>Drivers must <em>always</em> yield to blind pedestrians, 
who will usually use a white cane and/or be accompanied by 
a guide dog. Failure to yield to the visually impaired is a 
misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and/or a 
$500 – $1,000 fine.</li>

<p>Pedestrians have responsibilities that are fulfilled mostly by 
remaining as visible as possible and behaving predictably around motor 
vehicles. They should watch out for aggressive drivers before assuming 
that they have the right-of-way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pedestrians should never dart in front of a vehicle that 
may be close enough to present a clear and present danger. This 
is true even if they are in a crosswalk. Pedestrians should look 
both ways—left, then right, then left again!—before 
stepping into the street, and yield the right-of-way to any 
vehicle that was already in the intersection.</li>
<!-- CVC 21950(b), 21954; 2013DH, p. 17 -->
<li>At intersections, pedestrians should watch motorists 
carefully, making eye contact to ensure that they were spotted 
before proceeding.</li>
<!-- 2013DH, p. 24 -->
<li>Pedestrians, like vehicles, are to obey traffic signals.</li>
<ul>
<li>A pedestrian signal will display the word "WALK," or a 
white icon of a person walking, when it is legal to cross. 
A signal displaying the words "DON'T WALK," or an orange 
icon of an upraised hand, indicates that pedestrians may not 
cross. If a "DON'T WALK" signal is flashing, pedestrians 
may not start crossing (since the signal is about to change), 
but should finish a crossing already in progress.</li>
<li><em>Countdown signals</em> may be paired with flashing 
"DON'T WALK" or upraised hand signals to indicate the time (in 
seconds) remaining for crossing. When a countdown signal is 
present, pedestrians may start a crossing; but they must 
finish crossing by the time a steady "DON'T WALK" or upraised 
hand signal is displayed when the countdown ends.</li>
<!-- CVC 21456 -->
<li>Some signals emit beeps, chirps, or another audible 
indicator to assist visually impaired pedestrians.</li>
<li>At some traffic signals, pedestrians may need to push a 
button to activate the "WALK" signal.</li>
<li>In the absence of pedestrian-specific signals, those on 
foot are to observe the traffic signals while carefully 
monitoring vehicle traffic to ensure safety.</li>
<!-- 2013DH, p. 21 - 22 -->
</ul>
<li>A pedestrian must not stop while crossing or otherwise 
unnecessarily delay traffic.</li>
<!-- CVC 21950(b) -->
<li>Between adjacent controlled intersections, pedestrians 
may cross only at crosswalks.</li>
<!-- CVC 21955 -->
<li>Pedestrians should use sidewalks whenever they are 
available. Where there are no sidewalks, pedestrians are 
encouraged to walk on the street <em>facing oncoming traffic</em> 
whenever possible. Pedestrians walking on a roadway outside of 
a business or residence district must remain close to their 
left-hand edge of the roadway; however, they may walk close 
to the right-hand edge if a crosswalk or other means of safely 
crossing the road is not available or if existing traffic or 
other conditions would compromise the safety of a pedestrian 
attempting to cross the road.</li>
<!-- CVC 21956; 2013DH, p. 17 -->
<li>Pedestrians should wear light or reflective clothing and/or 
carry a light when walking at night or in other conditions of 
low visibility.</li>
<!-- 2013DH, p. 17 -->
<li>Pedestrians are not allowed on freeways where signs state 
that pedestrians are not allowed. Nor are pedestrians permitted 
on any toll bridge or highway crossing unless there is a 
sidewalk and signs stating that pedestrian traffic is 
allowed.</li>
<!-- CVC 21960; 23331. (CVC 21109 (?)) -->

<p>Walking is a healthful and environmentally friendly mode of 
transportation, and drivers should respect the presence of pedestrians 
and take care to ensure their safety. In turn, those on foot should 
recognize the danger that a moving motor vehicle presents and observe 
the rules that have been established for their own protection.</p>

<h2>Driving Maneuvers</h2>

<h3>Parking</h3>

<p>The funny thing about driving responsibly is that the responsibility 
begins even before you begin driving. Before you even think about 
sliding behind the wheel, your vehicle has to exist somewhere, right? 
Where it exists when you're not driving it is where it's <em>parked</em>. 
Although parking may appear uncomplicated, it is crucial that drivers be 
aware of and consider certain factors.</p>

<h4>General Parking Regulations</h4>

<p>Parked automobiles are to have their right-hand wheels parallel with 
and within 18 inches of the right-hand curb, while motorcycles must 
have at least one wheel or fender touching the curb. (Drivers may park 
on the left side of one-way streets where parking is allowed.) Where no 
curbs or barriers mark the edge of the road, vehicles are to be parked 
as far off of the main-traveled portion of the roadway as possible. As 
well, be sure to watch carefully for posted signs—and obey their 
instructions—in order to avoid getting a parking citation!</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Boxed_In.jpg" alt="Boxed In">
<div class="caption">Be thoughtful when parking. <br>
Don't box in your fellow drivers.</div>
</div>

<p>Drivers should never exit a vehicle without first stopping the 
engine and setting the parking brake. Exit the vehicle carefully, 
waiting for passing traffic to clear before you get out. Open doors 
on the traffic side of a vehicle only long enough to load or unload 
passengers. Many times it is safer for passengers to exit the vehicle 
from the curb side.</p>

<p>Drivers should also be aware of where they are allowed to park and 
where parking is forbidden. Except to avoid a conflict with traffic, 
or at the direction of a law enforcement officer, drivers may never 
park, stop, or stand a vehicle in the following places:</p>

<ul>
<li>where parking is prohibited by signs or pavement markings</li>
<li>on the side of the street facing oncoming traffic</li>
<li>in an intersection</li>
<li>on a sidewalk or in a crosswalk (whether the crosswalk is 
marked or unmarked)</li>
<li>where a curb has been lowered to allow wheelchair access to 
the sidewalk</li>
<li>between a safety zone and the adjacent right-hand curb</li>
<li>within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, unless a licensed driver 
is seated in the front seat and can immediately move the vehicle 
if necessary</li>
<li>within 15 feet of the driveway entrance to a fire station</li>
<li>in a tunnel or on a bridge, except where permitted by signs</li>
<li>on or within 7 1/2 feet of a railroad track</li>
<li>in front of a driveway (public or private)</li>
<li>around a construction zone, where stopping, standing, or 
parking would obstruct traffic</li>
<li>on the roadway side of another parked vehicle (also referred 
to as <em>double parking</em>)</li>
<li>in a zone reserved for the loading and unloading of bus 
passengers</li>
<li>in or obstructing any space reserved for disabled persons, 
unless the vehicle is appropriately plated or placarded</li>
</ul>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Hill_Parking.jpg" alt="Hill Parking">
<div class="caption" align="center">When parking on a hill, turn 
your wheels to avoid rollaways.</div>
</div>

<h4>Parking on a Hill</h4>

<p>When you park on an incline, reasonable precautions should be taken 
to prevent the vehicle from rolling away. Set your parking brake and 
leave the vehicle in gear (manual transmission) or in the "park" 
position (automatic transmission). Turn the front wheels of the vehicle 
so they will come to rest against the curb if the car should start to 
roll. If there is no curb, turn the front wheels so that the rear of 
the vehicle will roll away from traffic.</p>

<h3>Backing Up</h3>

<p>The California Vehicle Code permits backing when it is "reasonably 
safe" to do so, but there are many considerations that go into making 
the maneuver safe. To be honest, it would be better if we never had to 
drive our vehicles in reverse. Many drivers have difficulty maneuvering 
their vehicles when backing because they are not used to driving in 
reverse. Moreover, reversing motorists need to take special care to 
"get the big picture," as there is a decreased range of view and an 
enlarged blind spot when moving backward.</p>
<!--CVC 22106-->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Reverse.jpg" alt="Reverse">
</div>

<p>More than half of reversing collisions include larger vehicles, such 
as SUVs, trucks, and vans. This should come as no surprise, since larger 
vehicles have larger blind spots. But even smaller passenger vehicles 
can have blind spots approaching 43 square feet. Therefore, drivers 
need to get a complete picture of the area around a soon-to-be reversing 
vehicle. And it is imperative that drivers assume the proper posture for 
the backing maneuver, and proceed slowly and carefully.</p>

<h4>Before Backing</h4>

<p>The most common place you're likely to drive in reverse is your own 
driveway. Ironically, this is also one of the places where unseen 
obstacles are most likely to collect. Children may play around vehicles 
or come out to bid you farewell; pets often seek shelter from the 
elements or unwanted attention underneath vehicles; and toys, displaced 
rocks, or broken glass may litter the ground around vehicles. Before 
you slide behind the wheel, walk around the vehicle and check for 
obstacles. Your children, your pets, or your property may be at stake!</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Before_Backing.jpg" alt="Before Backing"></div>

<h4>Visibility and Posture</h4>

<p>In order to back safely and effectively, it is vital that you get 
into the correct sitting position. Shift your weight onto your right 
hip, turn your torso 3/4 of the way to your right, and put your right 
arm over the back of the front passenger's seat. You'll use your left 
hand, placed at the top of the steering wheel, to control your direction.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Backing_Posture.jpg" alt="Backing Posture">
<div class="caption">Don't rely on your mirrors or camera when <br>
backing. Turn your body toward the passenger <br>
side of the vehicle. Place your right hand on <br>
the back of the front passenger's seat and your <br>
left hand on the top of the steering wheel.</div>
</div>

<p>Don't be overly dependent upon what you see in your mirrors or your 
back-up camera display, as you may not be getting the whole picture. Mirrors 
and cameras can be useful instruments, but they should not be relied upon. 
Instead, concentrate on what you can observe with your own eyes by looking 
out the rear window of the vehicle. Scan the entire area behind you to get 
the "big picture."</p>

<h4>Speed and Steering</h4>

<p>You've been told to take it slow while backing, but how are you 
supposed to know if you are moving "too fast?" There is no set speed 
limit for backing up. After all, you <em>should</em> have your 
attention focused to the rear of the vehicle instead of on the 
speedometer. What's a driver to do? Rather than giving a specific speed, 
we recommend that drivers simply cover the brake pedal and back at idle 
speed. Be mindful that a cold engine (one that has been at rest for an 
extended period and/or exposed to chilly weather) may idle at a high 
speed, causing the vehicle to jump backward at an unexpectedly fast 
rate.</p>

<p>Many drivers are confused about steering while driving in reverse, 
which is one reason why backing is such a hazardous maneuver. To 
control the path of your vehicle, turn the steering wheel in the 
direction you wish to go—just as you would if you were moving 
forward. If you proceed slowly and carefully, you should have little 
trouble controlling the vehicle.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Stop_Sidewalk-Street.jpg" alt="Stop Sidewalk-Street">
<div class="caption">When backing out of a driveway, <br>
stop before you reach the sidewalk <br>
and again before you reach the <br>
roadway—just as you would if you <br>
were driving forward. Proceed only <br>
when the path is clear and safe.</div>
</div>

<p>While we're talking about turning, let's discuss backing around a 
corner. This has the potential to be extremely dangerous, and we're 
not sure why anyone would try it when there are other options readily 
available (driving around the block, or turning around so you can make 
the turn moving forward). For those situations when you feel that you 
absolutely <em>must</em> back around a corner, complete the maneuver 
in two shifts. First back to the corner, as you normally would. Then, 
when you are absolutely sure that the coast is clear on the cross 
street, proceed around the corner. If you have a passenger, have that 
person direct you and warn cross-traffic drivers.</p>

<h4>Other Considerations While Backing</h4>

<p><strong>The Freeway.</strong> We'd like to believe this goes without 
saying, but…you must <em>never</em> drive in reverse on a 
freeway. It's worth noting, however, that this rule applies to the 
shoulders as well as to the main-traveled portion of the roadway.</p>

<p><strong>Get Some Assistance.</strong> If you have passengers, you 
might as well put them to good use. Instead of asking your fellow 
travelers to change positions or adjust their posture so you can get 
a better look at surrounding traffic while backing, ask them to give 
you a current traffic report. Most passengers are more than willing to 
assist the driver, and their information can be especially helpful when 
trying to navigate through a crowded area like a packed parking 
structure.</p>

<p><strong>Parking Lots and Swing-Out.</strong> When parking in lots, 
pull through parking spaces into an open-facing spot where possible; 
or park in an end-of-row spot that you can pull out of by driving 
forward. Either of these techniques works when there are wide, two-way 
lanes between the rows of parked vehicles. When there is only a one-way 
lane of traffic between rows, avoid these tactics, as they will get you 
going against the flow of traffic in the lot.</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Pull_Through_Parking.jpg" alt="Pull Through Parking">
<div class="caption" align="center" style="padding-left:40px">When possible, 
pull through a parking space and into the facing space <br>
in a parking lot. This allows you to leave your space by driving forward <br>
and eliminates the need for a dangerous backing maneuver.</div>
</div>

<p>When backing out of a parking space, beware of vehicles' tendency to 
swing out. <em>Swing-out</em> refers to the tendency of the front of 
the vehicle to move toward the lateral limits of a parking spot as you 
simultaneously back and turn. With a full turn of the steering wheel 
the swing-out can be severe. Watch for unobservant pedestrians as you 
back, and take care not to "ding" an adjacent vehicle. The most obvious 
solution to swing-out is to back straight out of the spot and begin 
your turn only when you have cleared the vehicles on either side. In 
tight lots, however, this is not always practical. In those cases, 
begin your backing maneuver and, once you have made certain that the 
area behind you is clear, turn back to watch the front of your vehicle. 
Continue alternating your gaze between the front and the back of your 
vehicle as you pull out of the spot.</p>

<h3>Lane Changes</h3>

<p>Changing lanes is a maneuver that will most often be used on roadways 
with two or more lanes of traffic moving in your direction of travel. 
(Merging onto or off of a freeway and entering the road from the curb 
or shoulder are also lane changes). You might need to change lanes to be 
in a better position to make a left or right turn. Or, you might change 
lanes in order to pass another vehicle or to increase your field of view 
(e.g., if you were following a large truck).</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Blind_Spots.jpg" alt="Blind Spots">
<div class="caption">Whenever you change lanes, make <br>
sure to check your blind spots before <br>
starting the maneuver. You never know <br>
what might be there until you look!
</div>
</div>

<p>By employing defensive driving techniques to get the "big picture," 
you will be aware of traffic patterns in your immediate 
environment—and whether a lane change would be advisable at a 
given moment. Remember to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check traffic in front, behind, and beside you.</li>
<li>Glance over your shoulder (in the direction that you want 
to change lanes) to make sure the adjacent lane is clear.</li>
<li>Look for all vehicles, including motorcycle and bicycle 
traffic, in your blind spot.</li>
<li>Make sure there is enough room for your vehicle in the next 
lane.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before changing lanes, signal your intention continuously for 100 
feet (for at least 5 seconds on a freeway), and check your mirrors and 
blind spot to make sure the coast is clear. When you have sufficient 
room, turn the steering wheel gently and merge smoothly into the new 
lane, keeping pace with the traffic there.</p>
<!--signaling: CVC 22107 - 22108; 2014DH, p. 40 - 41-->

<h3>Passing</h3>

<p><em>Passing</em>, or <em>overtaking</em>, is the act of driving 
around another, slower vehicle on the road. Unfortunately, passing 
often requires drivers to temporarily enter a lane assigned to traffic 
traveling the opposite direction. Passing on a two-lane highway is the 
only time a vehicle is legally allowed to cross into oncoming traffic. 
This is also the single most dangerous driving maneuver.</p>

<p>Numerous considerations go into deciding whether a pass is legal 
and safe. If at any point the conditions deviate from the ideal, 
the passing maneuver should be abandoned. Ultimately, each and every 
time you pass—be it by making a simple lane change or by crossing 
into an lane of opposing traffic—you increase your chances of a 
collision. Before attempting a pass, you should <em>always</em> ask 
yourself, "Is the extra risk really worth the few seconds I might gain 
by passing?"</p>

<h4>The Demands of Proper Passing</h4>

<p>In order to pass safely, drivers must exhibit good judgment and 
rapid decision-making skills. While you may need to make split-second 
decisions, don't rush into rash decisions. Rather, make <em>good</em> 
decisions <em>quickly</em>.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Stopwatch.jpg" alt="Stopwatch">
<div class="caption">Passing is all about the timing: <br>
<em>When</em> you make the maneuver <br>
and whether you'll have <em>time <br>
to complete it safely</em>.
</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Good Judgment</strong></p>

<p>If you are going to attempt to overtake a slower vehicle, you must 
be able to accurately judge the time needed and the space required 
versus what is available. Before even trying to pass, you must assess 
what's going on around you, especially in the lane of oncoming traffic 
lane. Make sure you have an unhindered view of the roadway in both 
directions, and use that view to determine whether a pass will be 
safe—or whether it is even necessary at this particular location. 
Consider the positions and (supposed) intentions of the drivers around 
you, and note any weather or road conditions which might hamper the 
maneuver.</p>

<p>Next, you must estimate the space needed to make the pass safely, 
and make sure that there is no vehicle behind that may attempt to pass 
at the same time. It helps to have a realistic awareness of the 
performance characteristics of the vehicle you are driving. That way 
you'll know whether you'll actually be able to make the pass that you're 
considering. At highway speeds, you'll need at least a 10 – 12 
second gap in oncoming traffic to pass safely. At 55 mph, you will travel 
over 800 feet in 10 – 12 seconds, as will an oncoming vehicle. You 
will, therefore, need over 1,600 feet (about a third of a mile) to pass 
safely.</p>
<!--2013 DH, p. 55-->

<p>The idea is that you pass only when you "need" to and are safely able to, 
not simply when you are frustrated because you are stuck in traffic and 
<em>want</em> to pass.</p>

<p><strong>Rapid Decision-Making</strong></p>

<p>Passing requires that you make good decisions and that you make those 
decisions <em>quickly</em>. Driving situations can change in the blink 
of an eye, and the judgments you might make at times even a few seconds 
apart may vary widely. For instance, a driver who is second in a long 
line of cars lead by a slow-moving vehicle may be tempted to pass. But 
hesitation can cause an impatient driver farther back in the line to 
pass instead, negating the opportunity.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Passing_Multi-Lane.jpg" alt="Passing Multi-Lane">
<div class="caption">Passing when there are multiple <br>
lanes moving in your direction <br>
amounts to a simple lane change.</div>
</div>

<h4>When Passing Is Allowed</h4>

<p>Passing on a road with multiple lanes of traffic traveling in the 
same direction (e.g., a freeway) consists merely of making a lane change 
before overtaking the slower vehicle. This sort of maneuver is relatively 
safe, so long as you change lanes carefully.</p>

<p>Ideally, slower traffic will keep to the right, and you should pass 
to the left of slower vehicles. However, it is permissible to pass on 
the right…</p>

<ul>
<li>when the vehicle being overtaken is making or is preparing 
to make a left turn.</li>
<li>on a highway within a business or residence district where 
the pavement is wide enough to allow two vehicles to travel 
side-by-side in the same direction.</li>
<li>on any highway outside of a business or residence district 
with two or more marked lanes of traffic moving in the same 
direction.</li>
<li>on a one-way street.</li>
<li>on a divided highway with two or more lanes of moving 
traffic in the same direction.</li>
<li>when it is possible to complete the maneuver safely and 
without leaving the paved or main-traveled portion of the 
roadway.</li>
</ul>
<!--CVC 21754-->

<p>Passing on a two-lane highway (with one lane of traffic moving in 
each direction) is slightly more complex, because the maneuver puts you 
directly into the path of oncoming vehicles. BE CAREFUL! Driving into 
a lane of oncoming traffic could be the first step toward one of the 
most dangerous events on the roadway: the head-on collision.</p>

<p>On a two-lane highway, watch the lane lines and for prohibiting 
signage to determine whether a pass is legal at a given point.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A broken yellow line</strong> separates opposing 
lanes of traffic, but may be crossed to initiate a pass so long 
as it would otherwise be safe to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Double yellow lines, one solid and one 
broken,</strong> separate opposing lanes of traffic and indicate 
that <em>the lane of traffic bordered by the broken line may 
pass</em>. Again, where a broken yellow line borders your lane, 
you may cross it to pass; where a solid yellow line borders your 
lane, you may not.</li>
<li><strong>Double solid yellow lines</strong> indicate that 
neither lane of traffic may pass. You may never pass over a 
solid yellow line.</li>
</ul>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Passing.jpg" alt="Passing"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>When Passing Is Prohibited</h4>

<p>On a road with multiple lanes of travel in your direction, it is 
illegal to overtake a vehicle that has stopped to allow pedestrians 
to cross. Remember, also, that motorists are never allowed to enter a 
freeway's high-occupancy vehicle lane ("carpool lane") to pass unless 
they would normally have access to the lane at that point.</p>

<p>On roadways with a single lane of traffic traveling in each direction, 
drivers are prohibited from passing under the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>when signs or pavement markings prohibit the maneuver</li>
<li>when there is insufficient clearance to complete the pass 
without interfering with the movement of oncoming traffic</li>
<li>within an intersection or in the last 100 feet approaching 
an intersection or railroad crossing</li>
<li>upon the approach to a curve or to the crest of a hill where 
the driver's view is obstructed</li>
<li>within 100 feet of a bridge, tunnel, or viaduct where the 
driver's view is obstructed</li>
<!-- previous four bullets: CVC 21752 -->
<li>through a dedicated turn lane</li>
<li>when a school bus has stopped to load or unload children 
and has its flashing red signal lights (and stop signal arm, if 
so equipped) activated. (If the school bus is stopped on the 
opposite side of a divided or multi-lane highway (two or more 
lanes in each direction), you do not need to stop.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Passing Potential</h4>

<p>Before passing, you'll need to consider whether you'll be able to 
complete the passing maneuver in the time and space available to you. 
In short, you'll need to ascertain whether there is enough open road 
to complete the pass, and you'll need to target a space in the traffic 
ahead where you can return to your lane. If you're missing either of 
these two things, your pass could end very abruptly and well short of 
where you'd like it to!</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Pass_wCare.jpg" alt="Pass with Care">
</div>
<p>You should also consider atmospheric and road conditions. 
Precipitation can hinder visibility as well as traction. Broken 
pavement or loose material on the roadway might also compromise 
traction—and, therefore, your control over your vehicle.</p>

<p>You would also be wise to establish an escape route that can be used 
should the passing attempt go dangerously awry. If you are in the act 
of passing and you unexpectedly encounter danger from an oncoming 
vehicle or some other obstacle, you should have an escape route ready 
and be prepared to use it. A head-on crash is catastrophic and should be 
avoided all costs. You might want to focus on getting out of the way to 
your <em>right</em>, rather than to your left; the driver of an oncoming 
vehicle will probably attempt to recover to his or her right (your left). 
Ultimately, however, be prepared to steer into any open area.</p>

<h4>Steps for the Successful Pass</h4>

<p>Let's take a moment to examine the best way to identify a passing 
situation and how to successfully complete a safe pass. We'll assume 
that you are approaching from the rear a vehicle that is traveling well 
below the speed limit, and that you are first in line behind it. You 
are maintaining a safe following distance, which will allow you room 
to accelerate before you pull into the lane of opposing traffic. You 
should then…</p>

<ol>
<li>Verify that it is legal to pass by double-checking road 
signs and lane markings.</li>
<li>Look ahead for a clear path that extends from the point 
where you plan to initiate the pass through to its completion; 
establish an escape route to use in case something goes wrong. 
Abort the pass if…</li>
<ul>
<li>you don't have an unobstructed line of sight.</li>
<li>road surface conditions are poor.</li>
<li>you identify conflicts with oncoming vehicles, driveways, 
or other hazards.</li>
<li>you identify a vehicle closing quickly from the rear, 
potentially to pass you.</li>
</ul>
<li>Signal your lane change, and check your mirrors and blind 
spot.</li>
<li>Change lanes smoothly. Reevaluate your proposed path and 
proceed with the pass if it is safe to do so. If the path is 
not clear, fall back and resume your position behind the other 
vehicle.</li>
<li>Once you are ahead of the vehicle you are attempting to pass, 
signal your lane change back into your original lane of travel.</li>
<li>Maintain your position in the opposing lane of travel until 
you can see both headlights of the overtaken vehicle in your 
(inside) rearview mirror.</li>
<li>Re-enter your original lane of travel, watching to see that 
you are not accelerating into a vehicle that may be slowing or 
turning ahead of you.</li>
<li>Cancel your turn signal and adjust your speed to reestablish 
your space cushion as needed.</li>
</ol>

<h4>When You Are Being Passed…</h4>

<p>Courtesy and respect should be the rule in passing—and in 
being passed. They will help to make things quick and safe in a 
situation where time and space are of great significance.</p>

<p>Except when passing on the right is permitted, an overtaken vehicle 
is to safely move to the right-hand edge of the main-traveled portion 
of the roadway after an audible signal or a momentary flash of 
headlights by an overtaking vehicle.</p>

<p>When another vehicle is passing you, do not increase your speed 
until the overtaking vehicle has completely passed you. Ideally, simply 
do your best to maintain your speed; the driver of the passing vehicle 
should have factored your speed into his or her calculations, and your 
slowing down to "facilitate" the pass may confuse or disorient the 
other driver. Only slow down to create a merge gap if the passing 
vehicle is beyond you and is having trouble completing the pass safely.</p>
<!--CVC 21753-->

<h3>Recovering from Hydroplaning</h3>

<p><em>Hydroplaning</em> occurs when your tires cannot channel away 
water quickly enough to gain access to the road surface. Ideally, the 
treads on your tires act like a squeegee to push water into the grooves 
between them, where it is channeled away. Even in a light rain, your 
tire treads remove about a gallon of water per second from under each 
tire. At higher speeds or in heavier rain/deeper water, this squeegee 
action can't remove water fast enough. Likewise, the shallow grooves 
on badly worn tires remove less liquid. In either case, your tires can 
lose contact with the road surface and actually "ski" on a thin film 
of water. Under such conditions, the driver has lost control of the 
vehicle.</p>

<div class="img_l">

<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Car-Diving_Board.jpg" alt="Car-Diving Board">
<div class="caption">Stay out of deep water; and keep your <br>
speed down to avoid hydroplaning, <br>
which causes your tires to effectively <br>
"ski" on a thin film of water.</div>
</div>

<p>To avoid hydroplaning, replace worn tires, and make sure your 
vehicle's tires are inflated properly. An underinflated tire tends to 
ride on its sidewalls, squeezing together the grooves so that they can't 
remove water as efficiently. Above all, slow down; drive at a speed 
appropriate for the conditions. You might also try to drive in the 
tracks left by the vehicle ahead of you (a technique known as 
<em>channeling</em>), where the pavement will be drier until the water 
converges over it again—but do this only if you can maintain a 
safe following distance.</p>

<p>If your vehicle begins to hydroplane, gradually reduce your speed by 
easing off of the accelerator. Grip the steering wheel firmly and, once 
you regain traction, steer smoothly in the direction you want the 
vehicle to go. Do not brake, as this can cause your vehicle to skid.</p>

<h3>Recovering from a Fish-Tail Skid</h3>

<p>A fish-tail skid can happen anytime, but it is most likely to occur 
when traction is reduced by adverse road or weather conditions. The 
moment your wheels start to slide, you've lost control. You must 
attempt to regain control of your vehicle as quickly as possible, or 
the consequences may be dire.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Skid_Correction.jpg" alt="Skid Correction">
<div class="caption">When you feel yourself begin to skid, <br>
take your foot off of the gas and steer <br>
gently in the direction of the skid. <br>
Do not apply the brake, and take care <br>
not to oversteer.</div>
</div>

<p>Fish-tail skids can occur as a result of a variety of circumstances, 
but the technique used to regain control is always substantially the 
same:</p>

<ol>
<li>Always regain steering control before using the brake. 
In fact, the skid may have been caused by a braking action; 
release brake pressure immediately if this is the case.</li>
<li>Begin slowing the vehicle gradually by gently removing 
your foot from the accelerator. If you're driving a vehicle 
with a manual transmission, keep the clutch engaged.</li>
<li>Turn the steering wheel in the direction that the rear 
of the vehicle is skidding. This may feel 
counterintuitive—especially when you're headed toward 
some obstacle—but it's what will help you to regain 
control more quickly. You'll be able to steer away from any 
hazards once you have command of the vehicle.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Returning to the Road <br>
from an Uneven Surface</h3>

<p>On the side of most roadways, you'll find a <em>shoulder</em> that 
is intended to be an area away from the flow of traffic where motorists 
can find refuge when they encounter a problem while driving. But 
shoulders can be tricky. <em>Unimproved shoulders</em> are composed 
mainly of dirt or rocks, which may lead to rough braking and a loss of 
steering control. Be aware also that heavy rains and poor drainage on 
underdeveloped rural roads may cause some shoulders to drop off abruptly. 
Even freeways may have shoulders that are uncomfortably narrow. Do your 
best to get as far as possible from the main-traveled portion of the 
road if you must pull over, but carefully monitor shoulders before 
pulling off for any reason.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Bad_Pavement.jpg" alt="Bad Pavement">
</div>

<p>Should you unintentionally find yourself with a tire off of the 
roadway or on a low or unstable shoulder, take your foot off of the 
accelerator and continue steering along the shoulder until you slow 
to a speed that allows good control over the vehicle. Then, carefully 
steer back onto the roadway. If the shoulder is very low, you may need 
to turn fairly sharply to get the tires back up onto the road surface. 
If this is the case, perform the maneuver at a low speed and be 
prepared to countersteer immediately so you don't hit a vehicle in 
the adjacent lane.</p>

<h2>Defensive Driving</h2>

<p>The level of risk in the driving environment can be illustrated with 
the ratio 300:29:1. This ratio is an estimate of the number of unsafe 
driving behaviors to minor vehicle collisions to traffic fatalities. For 
each fatality on our nation's roadways, there are 29 minor collisions 
and 300 unsafe behaviors. Taking the total number of traffic fatalities 
in the United States in 2018 (36,560), we can then estimate that over 
<em><!-- 11.0 -->11 million</em> unsafe actions are performed on the roadways of our 
nation each year. In short, driving can be a pretty risky endeavor!</p>

<p>In the act of driving, the risk/reward ratio is so skewed <em>against 
reward</em> that it makes no sense to ever take excessive risks while 
you're behind the wheel. Good risk managers do not calculate risk/reward 
based on the single best thing that could happen; they calculate it by 
comparing a list of the best possible things that could happen to a 
list of the worst possible things that could happen, while factoring in 
considerations of the magnitude of those consequences. And <em>no</em> 
list of rewards, no matter how long or satisfying, can surpass the 
negativity of the worst possible outcome: a life altering, crippling, 
or fatal crash.</p>

<div class="img_r">

<div class="caption" style="padding-left:60px;">Drive safely and courteously <br>
at all times. The world needs <br>

needs a sudden gust of wind!</div>
</div>

<p>There will always be risk, of course, but the realistic objective 
of defensive driving is to reduce risk in the driving environment to 
<em>near-zero</em>. Drivers can reduce risk in two ways: by reducing 
their own unsafe behaviors and by attempting to anticipate and avoid 
the unsafe behaviors of others. That sounds great in theory, but what 
steps can you take when you're out on the road that will improve your 
odds of arriving safely at your destination? You're about to learn 
some defensive driving techniques that will help you to do just that!</p>

<h3>Planning Ahead</h3>

<p>An old maxim says that "Proper Prior Planning Prevents Pitifully Poor 
Performance." This is especially true with regard to modern vehicles, 
which can transport us far from home and deep into unfamiliar territory.</p>

<h4>Packing</h4>

<p>You wouldn't go on a trip without preparing a bag with clothes, 
toiletries, and other personal items that you need on a daily basis. 
But, what about those items that you'll need in an emergency situation 
on the side of the road? What about the gear you'll need to find your 
way safely and reliably to your destination? These are items that should 
go into your vehicle as well.</p>

<p><strong>Survival Kit</strong></p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Survival_Kit.jpg" alt="Survival Kit">
</div>

<p>We've already suggested that you should carry a winter survival kit 
in your vehicle when you venture out in cold, snowy weather. But there 
are items that you might consider taking with you <em>all of the 
time</em>. The idea is to take what you'll need to keep you safe in 
an emergency situation. But remember that excess cargo means excess 
weight in your vehicle that can rob you of valuable fuel economy. In 
other words, don't take everything and the kitchen sink. But do make 
sure you have what you need to get where you're going safely. A good 
survival kit might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>first aid kit</li>
<li>flashlight (with <em>good</em> batteries!)</li>
<li>gloves</li>
<li>rope and/or bungee cords</li>
<li>basic maintenance tools</li>
<ul>
<li>tire pressure gauge</li>
<li>jumper cables</li>
<li>screwdrivers (Phillips <em>and</em> straight, or a 
single driver with interchangeable bits)</li>
<li>pliers</li>
<li>adjustable wrench
</li><li>spare fuses</li>
<li>duct tape</li>
<li>utility knife/pocket knife</li>
<li>shop towel (or paper towels)</li>
<li>general-purpose spray lubricant</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Navigation Aids</strong></p>

<p>If you're just running some errands around your neighborhood, you're 
likely to be familiar with where you're going and how to get there. You 
probably even know some shortcuts and alternate routes. But if you're 
heading out to parts that are even remotely unknown, you should consider 
bundling some navigation aids in with your gear. That used to mean 
paper maps—and it still can, of course. But these days, you're 
just as likely to take a GPS navigation unit (assuming one isn't 
embedded in the dash of the vehicle) or a smartphone.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Woman_wMap.jpg" alt="Woman with Map">
</div>

<p>Always remember, however, that you should never bury your nose 
in a map—be it electronic or paper, in your lap or in your 
dash—at the expense of paying attention to what's going on in 
the driving environment. If you need to take more than a cursory 
glance at your navigation materials, pull into a parking lot or find 
a safe place on the side of the road before you attempt to regain 
your bearings. Getting lost <em>might</em> be dangerous, but it's 
<em>definitely</em> unsafe to hurtle distractedly down the road while 
fiddling with your navigation system!</p>

<h4>Checking Routes and Road Conditions</h4>

<p>Of course, waiting until you're on the road to use your navigational 
devices isn't the best idea. Knowing <em>beforehand</em> where you're 
going and how long it might take you to get there can save you a 
lot of time, trouble, and anxiety. On open highways through rural 
environments, things may not be marked as clearly as they are in more 
populated areas. If there's some sort of problem, you could easily wind 
up miles from help and have no idea which way to go. On the expressway, 
meanwhile, things are generally well labeled; but it may be difficult 
to backtrack should you miss your exit. And in the city, it's positively 
easy to find yourself lost and disoriented, with other drivers whizzing 
by you at every turn.</p>

<p>Planning your route to unfamiliar destinations helps you to maintain 
your confidence and makes you less distracted. You are less likely to 
maneuver erratically when you know where you are going. You are less 
likely to become overstressed, and you are more likely to focus on the 
driving task rather than on finding your way.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Computer-Pray.jpg" alt="Computer-Pray">
<div class="caption">Check the Internet for traffic <br>
in order to determine the least- <br>
congested route. Traffic updates <br>
on the radio can also help.</div>
</div>

<p>If you have a navigation system, you should program your destination 
into it <em>before</em> you set out. If you don't have a GPS unit or 
smartphone mapping application, you'll have to sit down in front of a 
computer before you leave the house. Or (gasp!), you may even have to 
dig out those old, musty paper maps. Whatever the case, determine your 
proposed route and plot waypoints as needed between your starting point 
and your destination. That way you'll know your turns in advance and 
be better able to make your way back to familiar territory if you find 
yourself off-course.</p>

<p>If you're planning to drive on highways or freeways, trace your 
route and note the names (where available) and numbers of entrances 
and exits. Note interchanges, and try to determine beforehand the 
path through an interchange that gets you from one freeway to another. 
Consider waypoints and landmarks, and estimate distances between them 
so you don't overshoot your destination.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Rush_Hour.jpg" alt="Rush Hour">
<div class="caption">Because of the cyclical nature <br>
of urban traffic, adjusting your <br>
travel time by a few hours can <br>
have dramatic effects!</div>
</div>

<p>In the city, note the cross streets at intersections where you will 
turn and the approximate distance between those intersections. Determine 
ahead of time which streets are one-way, which are two-way, which are 
larger thoroughfares, and which are smaller, quieter roads. Prepare 
alternate routes in case your main route is unavailable.</p>

<p>Finally, bear in mind that traffic patterns can change on an 
hour-to-hour basis. Right before you depart, check to see whether your 
routes are open and unobstructed, note where any delays might occur, 
and consider possible paths around congestion. Helpful information is 
available from highway patrol telephone hotlines, on traffic radio, 
or via numerous sites on the Internet.</p>

<p>Also consider <em>city cycles</em>. We're not referring to the new 
bicycle shop up the street, but rather the tendency of urban traffic 
patterns to repeat over time. Cities attempt to manage the flood of 
traffic on their streets by establishing schedules. Sometimes scheduled 
events are relatively frequent and fleeting (e.g., traffic signal 
sequences); in other instances they can be semi-permanent (e.g., lane 
closures or reversals). In addition to these induced cycles, organic 
cycles such as rush hours develop naturally in urban areas. By 
anticipating these cycles and planning ahead, you can increase the 
safety of your drive and save yourself a lot of time and frustration!</p>

<h4>Vehicle Inspections</h4>

<p>For commercial drivers, a pre-trip inspection is a normal part of 
driving. But quick pre-trip inspections should be a routine part of 
driving <em>any</em> vehicle. Part of your responsibility as a driver is 
to ensure that your vehicle is roadworthy—both for your safety and 
for the safety of others with whom you share the road. A short checklist 
might include a review of the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check the vehicle for broken lights, unsecured body panels, 
loose trim pieces, or any other visible damage.</li>
<li>Check the tires to make sure they are not flat or severely 
underinflated.</li>
<li>Check under the vehicle for leaking fluids.</li>
<li>Check around the vehicle for obstacles in your intended 
path.</li>
<li>Check to make sure that packages and passengers are properly 
secured.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to quickly address any problems that might impact the safe 
operation of your vehicle.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Auto_Parts.jpg" alt="Auto Parts">
</div>

<p>The above checklist should suffice for local trips and serves to 
ensure that your vehicle's basic systems are in reasonably good working 
order. If you're planning to take a longer trip, however, you should 
give your vehicle a more thorough once-over, or take it to a trusted 
mechanic for an inspection. With normal use, mechanical and electronic 
parts can deteriorate over time; and worn components are more likely to 
fail under the rigors of a long drive. It should go without saying that 
it's far better to have degraded items replaced in a comfortable, 
familiar environment than to face an expensive repair bill from a shady 
mechanic in a strange city—or, worse yet, to wind up broken down 
on a remote stretch of pavement with inclement weather threatening you 
and your passengers.</p>

<h4>Allow Extra Travel Time</h4>

<p>Many drivers wait until the last minute to hop in their vehicles; 
often, they have virtually no hope of reaching their destination on 
time. But that doesn't stop them from trying—sometimes to the point 
of running other drivers off of the road in their zeal to reach their 
destination at the appointed hour. Even under less extreme circumstances, 
drivers should be aware that it often takes longer for them to reach 
their destination than they think it will. This seems to be especially 
true when it is important that you arrive on-time at your destination: 
for a hot date or a job interview, for instance.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Time_Flies.jpg" alt="Time Flies">
</div>

<p>By acknowledging that travel often takes longer than you think it 
will, however, you can plan ahead and give yourself extra time to arrive 
at your destination safely and unhurriedly. Leaving a few minutes earlier 
than you think you will need to can help you to avoid the stress and 
frustration that go with running late. That extra time creates a more 
comfortable and healthful situation in and of itself. But consider also 
that the emotional pressure caused by stress and frustration can often 
goad drivers into taking risks that they wouldn't normally—and 
that risky actions can end very badly for those drivers and for others 
on the road.</p>

<p>If you still find yourself running late, despite your best efforts, 
the wisest strategy is to just deal with it. "Better late than never," 
the old saying goes—and that sentiment is never more pertinent 
than when you're driving. When you're held up by bad traffic, there 
is often very little that can be done to change the situation. Try to 
be patient, and take solace in the fact that you will arrive at your 
destination eventually. Despite what we may feel in the heat of the 
moment, the times that we will face severely negative consequences for 
being late are extremely rare.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Problems on the Road</h3>

<p>So…you've selected a destination and determined the best 
route to get there. It's time to hit the road! But, once you're on the 
road, what can you expect? The answer to that question is…just 
about <em>anything</em>! While that's an important realization, merely 
anticipating that <em>something</em> can happen is too broad to help 
you out of specific situations. Following are some suggestions and 
techniques that you can use to avoid problems on the road.</p>

<h4>Defensive Driving Systems</h4>

<p>Various programs have been developed over the years in an attempt 
to distill the actions of a defensive driver down to a few simple, 
easy-to-remember steps. These systems emphasize anticipating trouble, 
looking for trouble, and avoiding trouble before it becomes truly 
dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>SIPDE</strong></p>

<p><em>SIPDE</em> might sound like the brand name of the latest novelty 
straw, but it's actually an attempt to condense defensive driving 
techniques down into a handy, easy-to-remember acronym. By following 
SIPDE's five simple steps, drivers will find that they are able to 
safely handle most situations they encounter on the roadways.</p>

<p>SIPDE encourages drivers to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>[S]can the road.</strong> Keep your eyes moving, 
including periodic checks of your mirrors and instruments. Know 
what is in front, to the sides, and to the rear of your vehicle 
at all times.</li>
<li><strong>[I]dentify potential hazards.</strong> Pinpoint 
elements in the driving environment which might pose a problem: 
other vehicles, pedestrians, changing road conditions, traffic 
controls, etc.</li>
<li><strong>[P]redict likely changes.</strong> Anticipate the 
actions of other users of the roadway and other changes to 
the driving environment. Prepare for worst-case scenarios and 
formulate a short list of possible reactions to them.</li>
<li><strong>[D]ecide what to do.</strong> Choose the best 
option from your list of predetermined alternatives, given 
how the situation actually plays out.</li>
<li><strong>[E]xecute the maneuver.</strong> Communicate your 
intentions to other users of the roadway and make your move 
smoothly and confidently.</li>
</ul>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/SIPDE.jpg" alt="SIPDE"></div>

<p><strong>The Smith System</strong></p>

<p>Harold Smith developed the <em>Smith System</em> in 1952 to train 
drivers to think and drive defensively. Like SIPDE, the Smith System 
is geared toward helping drivers to fulfill three basic requirements 
for driving defensively: creating space around the vehicle; maintaining 
good visibility for yourself and making yourself visible to others; and 
allowing yourself the time necessary to detect driving hazards, make 
good decisions about how to respond, and safely evade them.</p>

<p>The Smith System revolves around five key points of action:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Aim high in steering.</strong> This is another way 
of saying "look ahead." Don't restrict your attention to what 
is immediately in front of you. For instance, drivers who look 
far enough down the roadway to give themselves a visual lead 
time of 15 seconds at 30 mph have allowed themselves over 650 
feet of additional stopping distance!</li>
<li><strong>Get the big picture.</strong> Defensive drivers 
are aware not just of the path of their vehicle down the road 
directly in front of them, but of the <em>entire driving 
environment</em>. Furthermore, the extent of your awareness 
should not stop at merely noticing the existence of objects 
"out there." Getting the big picture also means that you're 
mindful of the relationships between other drivers and objects 
and how all of those things can be expected to interact with 
each other and you.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your eyes moving.</strong> After all, how are 
you going to get the big picture if you don't actively look 
around? Focusing too intently on one facet of the driving 
environment makes you inattentive to the remainder, and such 
"tunnel vision" can make you slow to react to problems. Cycle 
your attention in all directions, and remember to check your 
mirrors every two to five seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Leave yourself an out.</strong> Make sure you 
maintain plenty of space around your vehicle. Don't get boxed 
in by other traffic, and always have a clear path that you can 
take out of danger in the event that an evasive maneuver is 
required.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure they see you.</strong> Remember that 
defensive driving involves seeing and being seen. Communicate 
with other drivers to let them know you're there. Seek eye 
contact and make proper use of your lights, signals, and 
horn.</li>
</ol>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Smith_System.jpg" alt="Smith System"></div>

<p>These defensive driving systems work to give you the opportunity 
to avoid road hazards before they become a real threat. And should a 
situation deteriorate, they give you time to react so a close encounter 
doesn't end up in a crash.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Hand_Positions.jpg" alt="Hand Positions">
<div class="caption">The best advice is to find a comfortable <br>
position with hands placed at approximately <br>
the same point on the left and right <br>
hemispheres of the wheel. Your thumbs <br>
should not be hooked inside the wheel, <br>
but rather used to grasp the outer ring. <br>
Whenever possible, employ a push-pull <br>
steering technique (begin the turn by <br>
pushing the wheel in the direction of the <br>
turn with the opposite hand, and then pulling <br>
it through the turn with the other.)</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> All of the defensive driving in the world 
won't matter if you can't execute the maneuver because you weren't 
gripping the steering wheel effectively. Keep <em>both hands</em> on the 
steering wheel when you drive!</p>

<p>Air bags, which deploy from the steering column, have generated some 
controversy regarding the placement of drivers' hands on the steering 
wheel. In the past, drivers were usually advised to grip the wheel at 
the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions ("10-and-2"). This has been 
criticized because of injuries that may be caused by air bag deployment, 
and drivers have more recently been encouraged to hold the steering 
wheel lower—in some cases, much lower. The NHTSA takes a neutral 
stance on hand position, but the <em>California Driver Handbook</em> 
recommends the 9-and-3 or 8-and-4 positions to reduce the possibility 
of a driver turning the wheel too sharply during a maneuver.</p>
<!--DH2013, p. 45-->

<h4>Anticipation</h4>

<p>As you might have guessed by now, defensive driving is really all 
about <em>anticipation</em>. Anticipation is more than just passively 
waiting for "something" to happen. It involves noting what is happening 
in the driving environment, predicting reasonable changes, and 
formulating a short list of responses.</p>

<p>To be most effective, drivers should look down the road approximately 
10 – 15 seconds of travel time ahead of their vehicle. In city 
driving, this equates to about one city block; at rural highway or 
freeway speeds, it equates to roughly a quarter-mile. But don't stare 
fixedly down the road. Keep your eyes moving in order to stay aware of 
"the big picture" of your driving environment and give yourself a better 
opportunity to predict and prepare for hazards. Scan from side to side, 
looking high and low.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Big_Picture.jpg" alt="Big Picture">
<div class="caption" align="center">There can be <em>lot</em> going on in the driving environment. <br>
To keep track of it all, you need to get the BIG picture. Look ahead <br>
of your vehicle 10 – 15 seconds (about one block in the city and a <br>
quarter-mile at highway speeds) and keep your eyes moving.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Whenever you cross other traffic (at an 
intersection, sidewalk, etc.), remember to look <em>left, then right, 
then left again</em>. With your first glance to the left, check for 
immediate hazards. If no hazard is detected, glance to the right to 
check for potential hazards. If the coast is still clear, check to 
your left again to account for changing conditions. Proceed slowly 
only when it is safe.</p>

<h4>Space Cushion</h4>

<p>You might think that a <em>space cushion</em> is something an 
astronaut sits on. In the context of defensive driving, however, it's 
the space that you put between your vehicle and others on the road. 
It translates into the time that you will have to take evasive action 
should the need arise. No matter where you're driving, you want plenty 
of space around your vehicle, and—make no mistake—you're 
likely to have to work to create it. Especially in congested traffic 
where vehicles are jockeying for position, other drivers are not 
necessarily going to give you the space you want.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Space_Cushion.jpg" alt="Space Cushion">
<div class="caption">Think of your space cushion as a force field bubble <br>
around your vehicle. Try to create plenty of space—<br>
but don't go to cosmic proportions!</div>
</div>

<p>There is no such thing as a space cushion that is "too big." Always 
try to build as large a space cushion as possible for yourself. Try to 
keep the areas to the sides of your vehicle—especially those areas 
that make up your blind spots—clear of other vehicles.</p>

<p>Do your best to avoid being followed too closely by another vehicle. 
Unfortunately, there is not a lot you can do about how closely another 
driver is following you. You could try tapping your brakes to flash your 
brake lights in the hopes of communicating your discomfort to the other 
driver, but resist the urge to brake hard and "scare" the other driver. 
This could cause the vehicle following you to rear-end you. Instead, 
increase your space cushion to the front and attempt to get out of the 
tailgater's way as soon as you can do so safely.</p>

<h4>Following Distance</h4>

<p>The portion of your space cushion between the front of your 
vehicle and the vehicle ahead of you is the part that is most easily 
controllable by you, and it has a special name: <em>following 
distance</em>. This spacing is critical! Not only do you use it to 
avoid hitting the vehicle ahead of you, but by slowing down to open 
up your following distance you protect your vehicle from being plowed 
into the vehicle ahead should you be rear-ended. Opening up a 
reasonable following distance also encourages tailgaters to go around 
you. Finally, an adequate following distance ensures that you have 
good sight lines around the vehicles in front of you.</p>

<p><strong>The Three-Second Rule</strong></p>

<p>California law states that a driver must "not follow another 
vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard 
for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon, and the condition 
of, the roadway." It's good to be aware of the vehicle code, but what 
does that mean in a practical sense?</p>
<!--CVC 21703-->

<p>A variety of methods exist to establish a safe following distance. 
Some suggest following at a certain number of vehicle lengths at certain 
speed ranges, but many drivers have trouble accurately estimating the 
space between their vehicle and others. The <em>Three-Second Rule</em>, 
which serves to put three seconds of travel time between your vehicle 
and the vehicle ahead of you, is useful at any speed and provides an 
easy, reliable way to maintain road safety. Establish your three-second 
following distance in this way:</p>

<ol>
<li>As the back bumper of the car in front of you passes a fixed 
point on the roadway (a sign post, a painted line, the shadow of 
an overpass, etc.), begin counting plainly, "One-thousand-one, 
one-thousand-two, one-thousand-three."</li>
<li>The front bumper of your vehicle should reach that same fixed 
point after the count of three—never before.</li>
<li>If you reached the fixed point at or after the count of three, 
you have a three-second (or greater) cushion.</li>
<li>If you reached the fixed point before the count of three, you 
are following too closely. Reduce your speed to open up more space, 
and repeat the test until you are following at a safe distance.</li>
</ol>

<div class="img_l"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Three-Sec_Follow.jpg" alt="Three-Sec Follow"></div>

<p>Avoiding a collision is a matter of driving at a safe speed for 
conditions and establishing space around your vehicle, and three seconds 
is the <em>smallest</em> distance one vehicle should be from the vehicle 
in front. You should increase your following distance under certain 
driving conditions—e.g., under adverse weather or road conditions, 
when your vision is blocked or visibility is poor, when following a 
motorcycle, when you are being tailgated, when you are towing/carrying 
heavy loads or following a vehicle that is, when the driver behind you 
wants to pass, or when you are merging onto a freeway. You might want to 
"upgrade" the Three-Second Rule to the Four-, Five-, or even Six-Second 
Rule, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<!--2013DH p. 53-54-->

<h4>Avoiding Blind Spots</h4>

<p>We discussed earlier that <em>blind spots</em> are the areas around 
your vehicle that cannot be seen in your mirrors or without turning your 
head (approximately the middle of your rear quarter panels backward for 
ten feet or so). We've already talked about how you must verify that 
these areas are clear before making a lane change in order to ensure 
that you will not hit another vehicle. For similar reasons, you should 
take care not to drive in another driver's blind spot. After all, that 
driver may not be as conscientious behind the wheel as you are, and you 
don't want to wind up in a fender bender!</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/No-Zones.jpg" alt="No-Zones">
<div class="caption"><em>No-Zones</em> are the blind spots <br>
that surround large vehicles. <br>
They are where a collision with <br>
an oversized vehicle is most <br>
likely to occur, because you can <br>
completely disappear from the <br>
driver's view.</div>
</div>

<p>This advice is particularly true for oversized vehicles, such as 
trucks, buses, and mobile homes, whose drivers sit high in their 
vehicles. The high perch gives them an excellent view of the road ahead. 
Unfortunately, this vantage point also inhibits their ability to see 
the areas immediately adjacent to the vehicle. These drivers have large 
blind spots directly in front, to the rear, and to the sides. Be careful 
so you don't find yourself stuck in one of those blind spots.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> If you cannot see the face of the driver 
of an oversized vehicle—either directly or in the 
mirrors—then he or she probably cannot see you! When in doubt, 
make eye contact to ensure that these drivers are aware of your 
presence. And always give them plenty of room.</p>

<p>The fact that the drivers of oversized vehicles may not see you 
is not the only danger that arises around these behemoths. They also 
present a hazard—especially near intersections—because they 
inhibit your view of oncoming and cross traffic. Stay well back from 
large vehicles so that you can see everything you need to see in order 
to drive safely. Remember that defensive driving entails both seeing 
and being seen.</p>

"Someone sideswiped me."</p>

<p>The boss asks, "That took an <em>hour</em>?!?!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
</div>

<h4>Planning for Evasive Action</h4>

<p>Ideally drivers will look ahead in traffic, anticipate problems, and 
modify their speed and position on the roadway in order to deal with one 
road hazard at a time. When that's not possible (e.g., there are parked 
cars to the right and oncoming vehicles to the left), the best thing 
to do is to "split the difference" by steering a middle course. If one 
danger is more hazardous than the others, give the greatest threat the 
most room.</p>

<p>On the rare occasion when all of your defensive driving efforts do 
not keep you out of trouble, you may need rely on your <em>escape 
route</em>. An escape route is a path out of imminent danger. It should 
be regarded as a "last resort," when a hazard has turned into a real 
emergency and it's either the escape route or a collision. Because the 
flow of traffic is changing constantly, drivers must continually revise 
their escape routes; but don't search for an escape route so obsessively 
that you divert your attention from the main driving tasks.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Escape_Route.jpg" alt="Escape Route">
<div class="caption" align="center">Because traffic patterns are in 
constant flux, you will have to <br>
revise your escape routes often. Escape routes may weave <br>
between other vehicles or even take you off of the road in <br>
extreme circumstances.</div>
</div>

<p>Once it becomes apparent that you will be required to use an escape 
route, commit to it without hesitation. Because you have picked it out 
beforehand, you are ready. Steer into it decisively and smoothly, 
repositioning your vehicle out of harm's way.</p>

<h4>Daytime Running Lights (DRLs)</h4>

<p>Scientific studies that have been conducted worldwide have tended to 
conclude that <em>daytime running lights</em> improve driving safety, 
and it is becoming increasingly common for newer vehicles to come 
equipped with them. These lighting devices, now often incorporating 
bright and energy-efficient LEDs, are installed in pairs on the front 
of motor vehicles and emit white, yellow, or amber light. They signal 
to other users of the roadway that a vehicle is approaching—even 
in the face of bright glare which might otherwise make the vehicle 
undetectable. If your vehicle was not factory-equipped with daytime 
running lights, they are available in aftermarket packages. Optionally, 
you can activate your headlights (on the low beam setting) during 
daylight hours in order to be more visible to other drivers.</p>

<h4>Avoiding Lane Changes Near Intersections</h4>

<p>It is illegal to cross into an opposing lane of traffic within an 
intersection or in the last 100 feet approaching an intersection or 
railroad crossing. While changing lanes (to a lane moving the same 
direction) in or near intersections is not explicitly prohibited by the 
California Vehicle Code, drivers are encouraged to avoid the maneuver 
because of the danger it presents. Intersections are where most 
collisions occur in city traffic; and with so many different vehicles 
moving every which way, it only makes sense for drivers to avoid making 
unexpected or unnecessary speed and positioning adjustments which might 
confuse other users of the roadway.</p>

<!--<p>Suppose, for instance, that another driver is preparing to make a 
right-turn-on-red to enter the street on which you're traveling. You 
don't necessarily expect that driver to pull out in front of you. Nor 
does the other driver necessarily expect that you'll change lanes 
directly at that turning vehicle. With both drivers performing maneuvers 
unexpected by the other, a collision becomes much more likely. It's 
best, therefore, if you simply stay in your lane and pass safely through 
the intersection.</p>-->

<h4>Scanning for Hazards</h4>

<p>Defensive drivers maintain good visual habits behind the wheel: They 
periodically check their mirrors and the dashboard instruments (the 
dashboard is where you'll find your speedometer, after all!), and scan 
the <em>entire</em> driving environment to remain aware of what is 
going on all around their vehicles. Some specific hazards to watch out 
for include:</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Parked_Cars.jpg" alt="Parked Cars">
<div class="caption">A line of parked vehicles can be as <br>
dangerous as vehicles in motion!</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Parked Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>If you are driving in a lane immediately adjacent to parked vehicles, 
it is a good idea to keep an eye on activity inside of those vehicles. 
A driver sitting inside of a parked vehicle could suddenly pull into 
traffic without looking or signaling. Or, any occupant could abruptly 
open a door and emerge from the vehicle. Stay aware of these potential 
hazards and take steps to ensure that you'll be able to stop or to 
swerve into an open spot in the next lane to evade the hazard. Be 
watchful also for pedestrians who might appear suddenly from <em>between 
vehicles</em>, from areas where your view might be obstructed.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles Taking the Right-of-Way at Intersections</strong></p>

<p>Remember that intersections are dangerous places, and other drivers 
don't always behave the way that you think they will—or the way 
that they should. The fact that you "have" the right-of-way in any 
particular situation does not mean you have no obligation to watch out 
for others. Drivers are expected to do whatever is necessary to avoid 
a collision, and one of the times you'll commonly have to fulfill this 
duty is when another driver unexpectedly takes the right-of-way in front 
of you at an intersection. Don't get upset by this. Simply let the other 
driver go. While that may not feel "right," getting into a collision 
just to prove a point isn't the best way to promote universal justice. 
Besides, the other driver likely did not intend the action as a personal 
affront to you. The important thing is for everyone to come out of the 
experience with life, limb, and vehicle intact.</p>

<p><strong>Before a Lane Change</strong></p>

<p>Lane changes are relatively simple driving maneuvers, but they can 
be dangerous if you are unaware of your surroundings. Defensive drivers 
look ahead in traffic to determine whether a lane change is necessary 
and advisable in any given situation. But it's easy to overlook those 
areas closer to your vehicle—your blind spots, for instance. Make 
sure to glance over your shoulder in the direction of your intended lane 
change before starting the maneuver, and proceed only when the way is 
clear.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Cover_Brake.jpg" alt="Cover Brake">
<div class="caption" style="padding-left:60px">Covering the brake.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Covering the Brake</strong></p>

<p>The brake pedal and the accelerator are used in concert to regulate 
the speed of a vehicle. Unfortunately, too many drivers are preoccupied 
with the accelerator and pay little attention to the brake pedal until 
they need to "slam" on it in an emergency. A better method of using the 
brake pedal is known as <em>covering the brake</em>: the driver removes 
the right foot from the accelerator and holds it in position to 
brake—hovering directly over the brake pedal, but not actually 
in contact with it—in situations where braking might be required. 
When braking is necessary, the driver can easily depress the pedal 
smoothly and gently. Meanwhile, if all turns out well,the driver can 
continue on without worry and without needlessly alarming other drivers 
with a flash of his or her brake lights.</p>

<p>Defensive drivers will cover the brake when they…</p>

<ul>
<li>notice other vehicles' brake lights illuminating ahead.</li>
<li>approach an intersection containing oncoming traffic waiting 
to turn left.</li>
<li>drive by a vehicle parked along the curb with a driver 
sitting behind the wheel.</li>
<li>observe any potential conflicts on the road ahead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, however, that <em>covering the brake</em> should not be 
confused with <em>riding the brake</em>. In the latter case, the driver 
actually rests a foot on the brake pedal and engages the brake lights 
with little or no slowing. Do <em>not</em> do this!</p>

<p><strong>Inattentive or Erratic Driving</strong></p>

<p>Another driver might be driving erratically for a variety of reasons. 
The person might be intoxicated. Or, he or she could be inattentive or 
occupied by any number of distractions: music, food, pets or children, 
a zombie attacking from the rear seat…. Regardless of the 
ultimate cause of the erratic driving, a defensive driver's response is 
substantially the same. Give the unpredictable motorist plenty of room, 
and try to keep the vehicle in front of you (where you can better see 
it and respond accordingly). If the driver is behind you and closing in, 
try to get out of his or her way as quickly (but safely!) as possible. 
If the person's driving is erratic enough or persists for a considerable 
period of time, you might consider asking the authorities to look into 
the matter.</p>

<h4>Enhancing Driving with Aids</h4>

<p>Modern vehicles are well-equipped, wondrous machines, and humans are 
incredibly adaptable creatures. Still, certain gadgets and devices can 
be used to make the driving experience safer and more comfortable.</p>

<p><strong>Sunglasses</strong></p>

<p>When driving during the daytime, especially in good weather, Mother 
Nature presents few challenges to the driver. Glare is an exception. 
When driving in bright, sunny conditions—particularly when driving 
into the sun—use your sun visors; look away from the light source 
to keep from being temporarily blinded. Use your peripheral vision to 
track other vehicles, since sunlight reflected from their surfaces can 
dazzle you.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Sunglasses.jpg" alt="Sunglasses">
</div>

<p>Sunglasses greatly improve comfort and visual clarity by protecting 
the eyes from glare and, more generally, from excessive exposure to 
ambient light. The lenses of polarized sunglasses can further enhance 
vision by cutting the glare reflected at some angles from shiny, 
non-metallic surfaces.</p>

<p>Drivers should, however, take care to avoid sunglasses (or any other 
eyeglasses) that have temples wide enough to block vision to the sides. 
Defensive driving is about seeing and being seen, and fashion frames 
with oversized temples can impact safety by significantly decreasing a 
motorist's field of view. The law prohibits a driver from wearing 
glasses with a temple of 1/2 inch or wider if any part of the temple 
extends below the horizontal center of the lens so as to interfere with 
lateral vision.</p>
<!-- CVC 23120 -->

<p>Meanwhile, drivers should never wear sunglasses at night or during 
other times of darkness. A popular myth making its rounds on the 
Internet encourages drivers to wear polarized sunglasses in order to 
see better in the rain. While a certain logic makes this recommendation 
believable, dark lenses will always reduce the amount of light—and, 
therefore, the amount of visual information—reaching a driver's 
eyes. These results might be helpful in glare conditions, but it is 
always undesirable when light levels are already low—e.g., under 
heavy clouds or in rainy conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Windshield Water Repellent</strong></p>

<p>Synthetic, surface-applied water repellents may be used to coat 
automotive glass with a hydrophobic film. While these valuable 
aftermarket products are most often applied to a vehicle's windshield, 
they can be used on any window. They encourage water to bead and roll 
off of the glass more easily, often without the need for windshield 
wipers. Despite the fact that auto glass water repellents are quite 
effective at boosting visibility in wet weather, drivers are 
nonetheless reminded that they should still use their wipers as needed 
to keep their windshields free of moisture. Also, while these products 
are generally easy to use, they must be reapplied periodically to 
remain effective.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Convex_Mirror.jpg" alt="Convex Mirror">
<div class="caption">Convex mirrors help drivers by <br>
showing a wide field of view. <br>
Objects do, however, appear <br>
smaller and farther away than <br>
they actually are.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Convex ("Panoramic") Mirrors</strong></p>

<p>We're all familiar with the "objects in mirror are closer than 
they appear" warning that appears on vehicles' passenger-side mirrors; 
movies have even made jokes at its expense. The warning is used to 
draw drivers' attention to the distorting effects of these convex 
mirrors on distance perception. While images in convex mirrors appear 
somewhat diminished and warped, these mirrors are preferred for use 
in vehicles because they present an upright image that provides a 
wider field of view than is possible with a "standard" (plane) mirror. 
Having a "fish eye" on your automobile will allow you to see a larger 
area to the rear of the vehicle. Convex mirrors help all drivers, but 
can be especially useful to older drivers or others with limited 
strength or flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>Audible Back-Up Warning</strong></p>

<p>Audible back-up warning devices are gadgets that emit perceptible 
beeps, chirps, or a spoken warning when a vehicle's reverse gear is 
engaged. These warning systems serve to notify pedestrians and other 
drivers in the vicinity of an equipped vehicle that the vehicle is 
backing up and that they should keep clear. These warning devices are 
especially useful for larger vehicles that have limited visibility to 
the rear, such as trucks, vans, mini-vans, and SUVs. Advanced systems 
can even self-adjust to emit a sound that is slightly louder than the 
ambient noise level.</p>

<h4>Giving Up Your Right-of-Way</h4>

<p>Again, drivers are responsible to do whatever they must in order to 
avoid a crash. There are times when you may "have" the right-of-way, 
but another driver, a bicyclist, or a pedestrian moves in such a way 
as to cut you off. Whenever you would be in danger of getting into a 
collision with another user of the roadway by exercising your right to 
proceed, you should surrender your right-of-way to the other party.</p>

<h3>Traffic Controls</h3>

<p>Drivers who are unprepared to quickly decode the messages of traffic 
controls will present a danger to themselves and to other users of the 
roadway. The danger is not just that a driver will misunderstand and 
make a mistake, directly causing a collision. Far more likely is that 
their indecision will create confusion and uncertainty in others. In 
order to drive safely and effectively, you must know the language of 
traffic controls!</p>
<!--CVC 21461, 21461.5, 21462-->

<h4>Pavement Markings</h4>

<p><strong>White Lane Lines</strong></p>

<p>Lines separating lanes in which the vehicles are traveling in the 
<em>same direction</em> are colored white. It is legal to cross 
<strong>broken white lines</strong> when traffic safely allows. A 
<strong>solid white line</strong> encourages you to stay within the 
lane, and dissuades lane changes near intersections and in other areas 
where such a maneuver might be dangerous.</p>

<!--<p><strong>Double solid white lines</strong> indicate a lane barrier 
between a regular use and a preferential use, such as a carpool lane, 
and may not be crossed to enter or exit the lane, except to make way 
for an emergency vehicle displaying a red light or siren.</p>-->
<!--2012DH p. 32; CVC 21460(b), 21655.8-->

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Basic_Lane_Lines.jpg" alt="Basic Lane Lines"></div>

<p><strong>Yellow Lane Lines</strong></p>

<p>Lanes in which the vehicles are traveling in <em>opposite 
directions</em>, are separated by lines colored yellow. It is legal 
to turn left or to pass over a <strong>broken yellow line</strong> 
when it is safe to do so and there are no signs posted prohibiting 
those maneuvers. Drivers may never cross <strong>solid yellow 
lines</strong> with the intent to pass, although left turns and 
U-turns (where otherwise legal) are allowed.</p>

<p>A <strong>broken yellow line alongside a solid yellow line</strong> 
indicates that passing is permitted from the lane bordered by the broken 
line, but not from the lane bordered by the solid line. <strong>Double 
solid yellow lines</strong> mark the center of a road and separate 
oncoming traffic. Passing is not allowed in either direction, and the 
lines may never be crossed except to make a left turn or a U-turn (where 
otherwise allowed).</p>
<!--2012DH p. 31 - 32; CVC 21460-->

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Pavement_Lines.jpg" alt="Pavement Lines" style="padding-right:40px">
</div>

<p><strong>Other Common Pavement Markings</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Edge Lines:</strong> Solid white edge lines mark the 
edge of the roadway, or the border between the shoulder and lanes 
of travel. Do not cross edge lines except to turn or to pull to 
the side of the road.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Lines:</strong> Where they are present, these 
thick, white lines (also referred to as <em>limit lines</em>) 
indicate the point at which vehicles must come to a complete stop 
for a stop sign or traffic signal.</li>
<li><strong>Arrows:</strong> White lines ending with an arrow 
indicate required turns and directions of travel in a lane. 
These markings may be used in conjunction with the word 
<em>ONLY</em> to emphasize that a lane is reserved solely for 
vehicles moving in the direction specified.</li>
<li><strong>Crosswalks:</strong> Found almost exclusively at 
intersections, these thick white lines denote the area in which 
pedestrians may cross the roadway. School zones often have yellow 
crosswalks, and drivers should be especially careful at those 
locations, as children may be present. Crosswalks in residential 
areas may not be explicitly marked; and some municipalities are 
now using decorative means, such as brick or cobblestone paving, 
to indicate crosswalks.</li>
<li><strong>Sharrows:</strong> <em>Shared lane markings</em> 
("sharrows"), the silhouette of a bicycle with two arrowheads 
above it, can be used to remind drivers that the roadway should 
be shared with bicyclists.</li>
<!--2012DH p. 35-->
<li><strong>Obstructions:</strong> Transit authorities may paint 
lines that guide drivers around obstructions in the road. These 
lines are slanted stripes which warn drivers that they should not 

cross into the marked area. Sometimes these lines are painted 
between pairs of double solid yellow lines to emphasize that the 
area is a no-drive zone.</li>
<li><strong>Railroad Crossings:</strong> Railroad crossings are 
often marked with two <em>R</em>s, one on either side of a large 
<em>X</em>, accompanied by a stop line, painted on the pavement 
at the approach to the crossing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Curb Colors</strong></p>

<p>In California, curbs may be painted one of five colors (beyond the 
standard gray of bare cement) to indicate what sort of activities are 
permitted on the adjacent roadway.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blue:</strong> A blue curb (or any parking spot 
marked with blue boundaries) indicates a parking spot reserved 
for a person with disabilities. Drivers can be cited for 
parking in a disabled-parking space unless they display the 
appropriate license plates or placard. If <em>any</em> part 
of your vehicle invades a disabled-parking space, you are 
considered to be "in" the space and you can be cited for a 
violation (punishable by fines of between $250 and $1,000).
<br><br>
Persons with disabilities may apply to the DMV for a 
disabled-parking plate or placard, providing proof of their 
need as verified by a licensed physician. It is illegal to use 
or to knowingly allow someone to use a disabled-parking plate 
or placard unless they are entitled to, and it is illegal to 
present or provide false evidence of entitlement. A parking 
placard that is issued to a person who is temporarily disabled 
expires 180 days from the date of issuance, and may be renewed 
a maximum of six times consecutively.
<br><br>
Vehicles displaying handicapped-parking plates or placards may 
be parked for unlimited periods:
<ul>
<li>in any zone with height restrictions for parked vehicles</li>
<li>in any zone that limits the time it is available for 
parking</li>
<li>without paying in a metered parking space</li>
</ul>
<br></li>
<li><strong>White:</strong> Drivers may stop next to a white 
curb only long enough to pick up or drop off passengers or 
mail.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Curbs that are painted yellow 
indicate loading zones. Vehicles may be stopped there only 
long enough to load or unload passengers or cargo. Operators 
of non-commercial vehicles are usually required to stay with 
the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Green:</strong> Green curbs permit time-limited 
parking. The allowed parking time will be painted on the curb 
or posted on a nearby sign.</li>
<li><strong>Red:</strong> Red normally means <em>stop</em>, but 
it's just the opposite when it comes to curb colors. Red curbs 
indicate that stopping, standing, and parking a vehicle are not 
allowed at that location.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Signs</h4>

<p>Drivers use signs for guidance, warning, and to learn what specific 
traffic rules are in effect in a given area. Other signs may simply 
provide useful information. Fortunately, a logical system governs 
the appearance of signs, helping drivers to quickly decode a sign's 
message.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Regulatory_Signs.jpg" alt="Regulatory Signs">
</div>

<p><strong>Regulatory Signs</strong></p>

<p>Regulatory signs inform drivers of required or prohibited actions. 
For instance, the most common regulatory sign, the speed limit sign, 
tells you the maximum speed you may travel. Always obey regulatory 
signs without question (unless otherwise directed by a law enforcement 
officer, highway maintenance worker, or school crossing guard). 
Regulatory signs are white with red and/or black lettering, and most 
are square or rectangular; but there are a few special cases.</p>

<p><strong>Special regulatory signs</strong> include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stop:</strong> Stop signs are red with white 
lettering, and are the only octagonal (eight-sided) sign. 
Drivers must come to a <em>complete</em> stop at the sign, 
stop line, crosswalk, or curb of the crossroad (whichever they 
approach first), then yield the right-of-way to any vehicle 
or pedestrian approaching on the crossroad. Stop signs at some 
intersections may be accompanied by a plaque beneath the sign 
that reads "ALL-WAY" or "4-WAY." At these intersections, all 
vehicles must stop; drivers are to proceed in order of their 
arrival, yielding the right-of-way to simultaneously arriving 
vehicles to their right.</li>

<li><strong>Yield: </strong>Yield signs are white, 
downward-pointing triangles with a thick red border and 
lettering. They indicate that you should slow—and be 
prepared to stop, if necessary—to give up the 
right-of-way to another user of the roadway.</li>

<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Warning_Signs.jpg" alt="Warning Signs">
</div>

<p><strong>Warning Signs</strong></p>

<p>Warning signs alert drivers to potential hazards ahead. Unlike 
regulatory signs, warning signs don't tell you specifically how to 
respond. They assume that you will use good judgment to respond 
appropriately to the situation. Usually, the proper response involves 
slowing down and being on the lookout for a hazard. Warning signs are 
generally diamond-shaped, and have black lettering on a background 
of yellow-gold or fluorescent yellow-green. As with regulatory signs, 
there are a few exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>Special warning signs</strong> include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>School Zone/School Crossing:</strong> Pentagonal 
(five-sided) signs with the usual warning sign colors indicate 
a school zone or school crossing. Slow down and be ready to 
stop. Watch for children crossing the street or playing, and 
obey the instructions of crossing guards.</li>
<li><strong>No Passing:</strong> Pennant-shaped (a triangle 
pointing to the side) signs with the familiar colors of a 
warning sign mark the beginning of no-passing zones. In these 
areas, you may not overtake slower vehicles ahead of you in 
your lane.</li>
<li><strong>Railroad Crossing:</strong> Railroad crossing signs 
are round, with a black <em>RXR</em> on a yellow background. 
Optionally, the sign may be a crossbuck (an X made from two 
white pieces of wood, with "RAILROAD" written in black on one 
and "CROSSING" written on the other). If more than one track 
crosses the roadway, a plaque posted beneath the warning sign 
will indicate the number of tracks. Flashing red lights and a 
gate may also be installed at crossings. Regardless of the 
method used to mark the tracks, you should slow down and be 
prepared to stop to yield the right-of-way to a train. Be 
especially alert at multi-track crossings, as a train could be 
approaching unseen on the second track.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Construction_Signs.jpg" alt="Construction Signs">
</div>

<p><strong>Construction Signs</strong></p>

<p>Orange signs with black lettering are clear indicators that you need 
to slow down and keep an eye out for activity within and around the 
construction zone. The safety of the workers there might depend on 
<em>you</em>. In addition to the standard black-on-orange signs, you 
should also watch for…</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flaggers:</strong> Workers may be stationed to 
direct traffic through construction zones. Normally, flaggers 
will wear orange, yellow, or yellow-green vests, shirts, or 
jackets. They use STOP/SLOW paddles or flags to direct traffic 
through the work zone.</li>
<li><strong>Channeling Devices:</strong> Cones, drums, and 
other barriers are employed to usher drivers safely through 
work zones. Diagonal stripes on a barricade guide drivers in 
the intended direction: stripes sloping downward to the right 
mean the driver should keep to the right, while stripes 
sloping downward to the left mean drivers should keep to the 
left.</li>
<li><strong>Flashing Arrow Panels:</strong> Large, portable 
panels with an array of lights can be programmed to flash 
arrows or other messages. These panels guide drivers through 
construction zones and provide useful information.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Guide-Info_Signs.jpg" alt="Guide-Info Signs">
</div>

<p><strong>Guide Signs</strong></p>

<p>Guide signs are green with white lettering, and are generally 
horizontal rectangles. They update drivers as to the direction and 
distance to destinations. They also provide information about 
approaching junctions and routes.</p>

<p><strong>Information Signs</strong></p>

<p>Information signs are also (generally) horizontal rectangles. 
<strong>Service signs</strong> use white symbols on a blue background 
to indicate the presence of gas, food, lodging, hospitals, airports, 
rest areas, and other services motorists might require. 
<strong>Recreational signs</strong> are rectangular or trapezoidal 
signs that mark recreational areas and points of interest, such as 
parks, campgrounds, and historical sites, with a brown background and 
white lettering.</p>

<h4>Traffic Signals</h4>

<p>While STOP and YIELD signs are often used on roads with modest 
traffic flows, electronic signals are employed on busier thoroughfares. 
Signals ensure a safe, smooth flow of traffic, and should be obeyed 
without question. There may be a lot of signals at exceptionally busy 
intersections, but the only one you need to worry about is the one 
that faces <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Traffic signals communicate primarily through color, and secondarily 
by the shape of the display. The signal lights display as red, yellow, 
and green from top to bottom (or from left to right on a horizontal 
array). Below is a description of the signals you might encounter and 
how you are to respond to each:</p>


<div class="course_video" align="center">
<video id="green_does_not_mean_go" controls="">

<!-- <div id="transcript1"><p class="content">
<span class="tran_voice">STEVE</span><br/><br/>

This is the biggest myth in the world of driving. Everybody listen 
carefully: Green does <em>not</em> mean "go." Let that sink in.<br/><br/>

You heard me right. Green does <em>not</em> mean "go." Let me tell 
you what it means. Green means go when it's <em>safe</em> to go. 
Green means it's <em>legal</em> to go, but it does <em>not</em> mean 
it's <em>safe</em>. Who makes that decision? Yes! The <em>driver</em> 
does.<br/><br/>

So, when you get a green light, you <em>don't</em> hit the gas. You 
do this: you look left, right, left again before you proceed.</p>
</div> -->


<ul>
<li><strong>Circular Green:</strong> Many people think green 
means "go," but it doesn't mean "go carelessly." Green means 
that you are to proceed—with caution. If you are turning, 
you must yield the right-of-way to oncoming vehicles or 
pedestrians in the intersection.</li>
<li><strong>Green Arrow:</strong> Proceed in the direction of 
the arrow when it is safe to do so.</li>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Green_Signals.jpg" alt="Green Signals"></div>

<li><strong>Circular Yellow:</strong> Yellow means "caution." 
A yellow light warns that the signal is about to change to 
red. If you have not entered the intersection, stop if you can 
safely do so. If you will be unable to stop safely, cross the 
intersection cautiously. Remember that speeding up to beat the 
red light could lead to a collision!</li>
<li><strong>Yellow Arrow:</strong> The protection of a green 
arrow is ending. If you intend to proceed in the direction of 
the arrow, be prepared to stop.</li>
<li><strong>Flashing Yellow:</strong> Slow down and proceed with 
caution.</li>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Yellow_Signals.jpg" alt="Yellow Signals"></div>

<li><strong>Circular Red:</strong> Red means "stop." Come to a 
complete stop before reaching the intersection, stop line, or 
crosswalk. Remain stopped for as long as the light is red. 
However, if you are turning and turns on a red light are 
allowed, proceed with caution when other vehicle and pedestrian 
traffic has cleared the intersection.</li>
<li><strong>Red Arrow:</strong> Do not proceed in the direction 
of the arrow until the red arrow light goes out. Turns are not 
allowed.</li>
<li><strong>Flashing Red Light:</strong> Treat a flashing red 
light as a stop sign: come to a complete stop and yield the 
right-of-way as necessary. You may proceed when the way is 
clear.</li>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Red_Signals.jpg" alt="Red Signals"></div>

<li><strong>Lane Use Signals:</strong> Indicate whether or not 
vehicles may occupy the lane in their current direction of 
travel. A circular red light or a red X means you may not use 
the lane. A circular green light or a green arrow means that 
the lane is available for your use.</li>
<li><strong>Signal Blackout:</strong> If a signal is not working 
because of a power outage or equipment malfunction, treat the 
intersection as if it were an all-way stop.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> By looking ahead in traffic, you can 
anticipate when a green light is "stale"—when it has been green 
for some time and is about to turn yellow. The ability to predict light 
changes and traffic flow at intersections will help you to avoid many 
dangerous situations!</p>

Using the Three-Second Rule will often give you a safe following distance, but you may need to enlarge it in certain circumstances.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h2>Collision Avoidance</h2>

<p>No driver <em>wants</em> to get into a crash. Collisions can be 
expensive, dangerous, even deadly! But despite your best efforts to 
interact civilly and safely with other users of the roadway, statistics 
suggest that you're likely to be involved in a collision at some point 
during your driving career.</p>

<h4>Time of Day</h4>

<p>At what time of day do most collisions occur? Why do you think this 
might be the case? Could it be because many people are on the road at 
that time? Maybe they're tired after a hard day of work. Or perhaps 
they've been out to dinner and had a few cocktails….

<h4>Gender</h4>

<p>There are a lot of jokes—on both sides—relating a driver's 
gender to their competency behind the wheel. But statistics clearly show 
that males account for significantly more crash fatalities than 
females—<em>almost three times as many!</em> Why do you think that is? 
How you might you modify <em>your</em> driving behaviors to keep yourself 
safer on the road?</p>

<h3>Common Causes of Collisions</h3>

<p>As we've noted, collisions don't "just happen." They happen because 
of <em>contributing factors</em>. Some common—and easily 
avoidable—contributing factors are discussed below. Hopefully by 
being aware of these dangerous circumstances, you'll be able to stay 
safe and avoid a crash!</p>

<h4>Unsafe Speed</h4>

<p>What is <em>speeding</em>? Is it going faster than the speed listed 
on those black-and-white rectangular signs that drivers see posted next 
to roadways? Or, is there more to it than that? For drivers in the 
state of California, speeding is defined as exceeding posted (or 
standard) speed limits <em>or</em> driving too fast to be safe under 
the existing conditions.</p>
<!--CVC 22351-->

<p>Driving at speeds in excess of posted limits accounts for most 
traffic citations. And, aside from driving while impaired by alcohol 
or other drugs, about the most reckless thing a driver can do is drive 
too fast for the existing conditions. Speeding nearly triples the 
likelihood that a driver will be involved in a crash or near-crash. 
It reduces a driver's ability to steer safely around curves or 
obstructions in the roadway, extends stopping distances, and increases 
the distance traveled while the driver reacts to a dangerous situation. 
Worse yet, when speeding is a contributing factor in a collision, the 
bodily harm and property damage is frequently more extreme than average.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Physics_Prof.jpg" alt="Physics Prof">
<div class="caption" align="center">Physicists use complicated equations to calculate the <br>
force of impact. What you need to know is that doubling <br>
your speed generates four times the force in a crash. <br>
Tripling your speed, nine times the force. It's easy <br>
to see that a little speed goes a long way!</div>
</div>

<p>The factors that control the destructive forces generated in a crash 
are: the mass of the vehicle(s) involved, the speed at which those 
vehicles were traveling, and the distance over which they come to a 
stop after the collision. If mass (weight) or speed increases, or 
the distance traveled after the initial impact decreases, the force 
generated by the crash grows. Obviously, vehicle speed is the factor 
most under your control in this equation.</p>

<p>Why is speed control important? How much force is <em>really</em> 
produced in a crash? Take a 3,500-pound vehicle—a reasonable 
approximation for a standard passenger automobile. At 65 mph, this 
vehicle striking a solid, stationary object would generate a whopping 
494,671 pounds of force. That's about 247 <em>tons</em>! A crash at an 
illegal (but hardly uncommon) 75 mph would generate approximately 329 
tons of force. Just imagine the damage that could be done in a head-on 
collision with another vehicle traveling at about the same speed!</p>

<p><strong>Three Collisions</strong></p>

<p>In a motor vehicle crash, there are actually <em>three collisions</em> 
that occur. The <strong>First Collision</strong> is obvious: the vehicle 
striking, or being struck by, another object. But the destruction doesn't 
stop there!</p>

<p>The <strong>Second Collision</strong> is commonly referred to as 
the "human collision." The vehicle itself has stopped moving (or is 
in the process of stopping), but the driver, passengers, and other 
unrestrained objects inside the vehicle continue to move at their 
pre-crash velocities. This motion takes place only in the blink of an 
eye, but terrible damage can take place when that movement ceases with 
the Second Collision.</p>

<p>The <strong>Third Collision</strong> is the "internal collision." 
After the human body ceases forward motion, the body's internal 
structures continue to move forward. Organs collide with other organs. 
Blood vessels tear. Under certain circumstances, the base of the 
brain can actually become detached from the spinal cord. The internal 
injuries resulting from this Third Collision can often prove fatal.</p>

<p>It's gruesome, but it's all but avoidable with speed control!</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Police_Officer.jpg" alt="Police Officer">
<div class="caption">Speed control is critically <br>
important for traffic safety. <br>
If you can't manage it by <br>
yourself, we know someone <br>
who can help!</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Minimum Speed Law</strong></p>

<p>Variation in speed is a leading factor in crashes, and drivers who 
drive too slowly may cause as many problems as those who drive too fast. 
Therefore, the California Vehicle Code states that drivers may not stop 
a vehicle on a roadway, or drive at a speed so slow that it impedes or 
blocks the normal flow of traffic, unless the reduced speed is 
necessary for the safe operation of the vehicle or in compliance with 
the law. In some cases, there will even be a posted sign that specifies 
a minimum speed (on the assumption that a vehicle can be operated safely 
at that minimum speed).</p>
<!--CVC 22400-->

<p>Help from the authorities aside, there is enough room in the Code's 
provisions to drive a truck through—if you'll pardon the obvious 
automotive reference. An individual driver's skills and comfort levels, 
as well as the vehicle being driven, can come into play when determining 
speed. What, then, should you do if you find yourself traveling slower 
than the normal flow of traffic? The law says that you must position 
your vehicle in the right-hand lane of traffic or as close as 
practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway. Drivers are, 
of course, allowed to move to the left to pass or when preparing for a 
left turn. Ultimately, though, drivers who are truly uncomfortable 
keeping up with the normal flow of traffic on a given roadway might want 
to consider taking an alternate route that offers slower speeds.</p>
<!--CVC 21654-->

<p><strong>Maximum Speed Laws</strong></p>

<p>The California Vehicle Code sets a maximum speed limit of 65 mph for 
any roadway within the state. It further stipulates that no one may 
drive a vehicle on a two-lane undivided highway at a speed greater than 
55 mph, unless the roadway has been specifically posted for a higher 
speed.</p>

<p>The California Department of Transportation, after consultation with 
the Department of the California Highway Patrol, may post a maximum 
speed limit of 70 mph for certain highway segments that would otherwise 
be subject to a maximum speed limit of 65 mph. Similarly, local 
authorities are allowed to post limits that are higher than the 
"standard" maximums (up to 65 mph) when engineering and traffic surveys 
suggest that those higher limits would ease the flow of traffic while 
remaining safe. Posted limits always take precedence over standard 
maximums, so watch for speed limit signs.</p>
<!--CVC 22349; CVC 22356 - 22357-->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Radar.jpg" alt="Radar">
</div>

<p><strong>Excessive Speed.</strong> It is expressly illegal to drive 
at a speed of more than 100 mph. A first conviction for this infraction 
is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and a possible license suspension 
of up to 30 days. For a second conviction within three years of the 
first, the driver may be fined up to $750 and suspended for 6 months 
(with exceptions for work). A third conviction within five years of 
the first two will result in a fine of up to $1,000 and a 1-year 
license suspension (with exceptions for work).</p>
<!--CVC 22348-->

<p><strong>Reckless Driving and Speed Contests.</strong> A person who 
drives a vehicle with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of 
persons or property is guilty of reckless driving. A person convicted 
of this offense can be punished by imprisonment in county jail for 
between 5 and 90 days, a fine of between $145 and $1,000, or both. If 
the reckless driving causes bodily injury to someone other than the 
driver, however, the penalties increase to between 30 days and 6 months 
of jail time, a fine of between $220 and $1,000, or both.</p>
<!--CVC 23103 - 23105-->

<p>It is illegal to engage in a motor vehicle speed contest or an 
exhibition of speed on a highway, and it is illegal to aid or abet in 
any way someone who does. Persons convicted of one of these offenses 
can be punished by imprisonment in county jail for between 24 hours 
and 90 days, a fine of between $355 and $1,000, or both. Persons 
convicted will also be required to complete 40 hours of community 
service, and may have their license suspended for between 90 days and 
six months (with allowances for transportation to work); they may also 
be put on probation. Furthermore, if the vehicle used for the offense 
is registered to the person convicted (or if the owner was present in 
the vehicle or if the vehicle was used with the owner's authorization), 
the vehicle may be seized and impounded at the owner's expense for not 
more than 30 days. If a speed contest or exhibition of speed causes 
great bodily injury to someone other than the driver, the person 
convicted could face imprisonment for between 30 days and 6 months, 
a fine of between $500 and $1,000, or both.</p>

<p>If all of those penalties aren't enough to deter, subsequent 
convictions within a five-year period are even harsher. But, of 
course, the real point to remember is that it's extremely dangerous 
to drive with such disregard for the safety of yourself and others. 
As a defensive driver, you would never do so!</p>

considerably longer to stop. Therefore, it follows that limiting the 
speeds of larger vehicles could reduce the incidence and severity of 
crashes in which they are involved. The following vehicles may never 
be driven in excess of 55 mph:</p>

<ul>
<li>a motortruck or truck tractor with three or more axles, 
or one that is towing any other vehicle</li>
<li>a passenger vehicle or bus drawing any other vehicle</li>
<li>a school bus transporting any school pupil</li>
<li>a farm labor vehicle transporting passengers</li>
<li>a vehicle transporting explosives</li>
<li>a trailer bus (defined as a trailer or semitrailer used 
for the transportation of more than 15 persons, including the 
driver, which includes a connected towing vehicle that is a 
motortruck, truck tractor, or bus)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Basic Speed Law</strong></p>

<p>All of this discussion about speed limits does not take into account 
what is commonly referred to as the Basic Speed Law. Posted limits and 
other maximums are proposed based on clear, dry, daytime conditions. 
The Basic Speed Law, meanwhile, states a vehicle may never be driven 
faster than is safe for the prevailing conditions. Inclement weather, 
compromised visibility, poor road conditions, and heavy traffic are all 
good reasons to reduce your speed. Selecting a "safe" speed ultimately 
requires an honest assessment of the situation based on common sense. 
You may be cited for speeding at any time if a law enforcement officer 
feels that the speed you have chosen compromises your ability to safely 
control your vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Speed, Time, and Distance</strong></p>

<p>Speed is a measure of the distance an object travels within a given 
period of time. Therefore, speed equates to the time necessary for a 
driver to complete an action <em>and</em> to the distance available 
to safely perform that action. The greater the speed of your vehicle, 
the less time and distance you will have to anticipate hazards and to 
execute the maneuvers necessary to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>The formula that describes your margin of safety with regard to 
speed and distance is:</p>

<div align="center" style="margin: 0 auto 0 auto;font-size: 12pt;"><div style="width: 175px; 
text-align: right; margin: 0 auto 0 auto; border-bottom: solid 1px #000;">
<div style="float: left;"><br>+<br>+<br></div>
Perception Distance<br>
Reaction Distance<br>
Braking Distance<br></div>
<div style="width: 175px; text-align: right; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">
Total Stopping Distance</div>
</div><br>

<p><strong><em>Perception Distance</em></strong> is the distance your 
vehicle travels from the time your eyes receive visual stimuli until 
your brain identifies those stimuli as a road hazard. The perception 
time for an <em>alert</em> driver is about 3/4 second. At 55 mph, you 
will travel approximately 60 feet in that time.</p>

<p><strong><em>Reaction Distance</em></strong> is the distance your 
vehicle travels from the instant your brain recognizes a hazard until 
a nerve impulse moves your foot and you begin to apply pressure to the 
brake pedal. Count this as another 3/4 second and roughly 60 feet of 
distance traveled at 55 mph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Braking Distance</em></strong> is the distance the 
vehicle travels while the brakes work to bring it to a stop. On dry 
pavement and with good brakes, this requires roughly 280 feet from 
55 mph.</p>

<p>Your <strong><em>Total Stopping Distance</em></strong>, then, from 
the time your eyes receive the stimuli until your vehicle comes to 
a halt from 55 mph, is about 400 feet. That's over the length of a 
football field!</p>

<div class="caption" align="center">
You don't have to double your speed to double your stopping distance. <br>

</div>

<h4>Driving on the Wrong Side of the Road</h4>

<p>Positioning the vehicle on the roadway is a task that is often 
underconsidered by drivers. But, by making proper use of lanes, drivers 
can increase the efficiency of the flow of traffic and avoid dangerous 
encounters with other vehicles.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Lane_Use.jpg" alt="Lane Use">
</div>

<p>Not all roadways have marked lanes of travel. If there are no 
obvious markings determining the lanes, or if the entire roadway is a 
single lane, it is drivers' responsibility to keep their speed down, 
stay attentive, and drive as far to the right side of the road as is 
practicable. Keep off of the road shoulder (where one is present), 
though, unless you need to pull out of the flow of traffic to deal 
with an emergency.</p>

<p>In most locations where traffic is heavy enough to be more than a 
fleeting concern, roadways will have markings to indicate individual 
lanes of travel. How, then, do you pick the proper lane in which to 
drive?</p>

<p><strong>Divided Highways</strong></p>

<p>Divided highways often have a physical barrier that makes it 
(almost) impossible for vehicles to travel into traffic moving in 
the opposite direction: a median strip or a concrete barrier or metal 
guardrail. A roadway is also considered to be divided if the lanes 
of opposing traffic are separated by two sets of double solid yellow 
lines that are two feet or more apart. Drivers may <em>never</em> 
drive on or across a dividing section, and left turns and U-turns 
are not allowed except at breaks in the divider that are intended 
to be used for such purposes. Drivers are to remain on the right 
side of the divider at all times, and any willful violation of this 
rule that leads to injury or death can result in a prison sentence 
of up to six months.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Divided_Highways.jpg" alt="Divided Highways">
<div class="caption" align="center">
Divided highways separate traffic moving in opposite directions with a median strip, <br>
a physical barrier, or widely spaced pairs of double solid yellow lines.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Laned Roadways</strong></p>

<p>Like divided highways, laned roadways provide distinct lanes for 
traffic traveling in opposing directions. Rather than a physical 
barrier or considerable expanse, however, here lanes of opposing 
travel are separated by little more than yellow lines painted on the 
pavement. Drivers must take care to keep their vehicles positioned 
within the lanes provided. No part of a vehicle may cross a lane 
marker unless a lane change or pass is being attempted and can be 
executed safely. Signs may be posted directing slow-moving traffic 
to use a designated lane or allocating specified lanes to traffic 
moving in the same direction.</p>

<p><strong>Three-Laned Highways</strong></p>

<p>Three-laned highways have…well, three lanes. The outside 
lanes are reserved for traffic moving in opposing directions, and 
drivers are to keep out of the extreme left lane (relative to their 
direction of travel) at all times. The center lane, meanwhile, is 
reserved for passing or left-turning vehicles, and is not to be 
entered except:</p>

<ul>
<li>to pass another vehicle</li>
<li>in preparation for a left turn</li>
<li>where signage allocates the center lane exclusively to 
traffic moving in your direction</li>
</ul>

<p>Enter the center lane of a three-laned highway only after 
<em>carefully</em> determining that it is legal and safe to do so with 
regard to visibility and traffic conditions. Entering the center lane 
should be done with extreme caution, as it is a prime location for a 
head-on collision. In fact, three-laned highways are an antiquated 
design that is being phased out because it is so dangerous.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Laned_Roadways.jpg" alt="Laned Roadways"></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The center lane of a three-laned highway is 
not to be confused with a <em>two-way left-turn lane</em>, though the 
two are similar. A two-way left-turn lane may be found in the middle 
of a two-way street, and is marked on each side by two painted yellow 
lines, the inner line broken and the outer line solid. If the street 
you're driving on has a two-way left-turn lane, you must use it when 
preparing for or making a left turn or when preparing for or making 
a permitted U-turn. When turning left <em>onto</em> a street with a 
two-way left-turn lane, you may use the lane before merging into 
traffic; driving across the lane and safely into an open traffic lane 
is not prohibited, however. You may not drive for more than 200 feet 
in a two-way left-turn lane, and it is never to be used by through 
traffic or as a passing lane.</p>
<!--CVC 21460.5; 2012DH p. 34-->

<p><strong>Exceptions to Driving <br>
on the Right Side of the Roadway</strong></p>

<p>While vehicles should normally keep to the right edge of the 
main-traveled portion of the roadway, there are times when drivers 
may need to position their vehicle elsewhere. Listed below are some 
exceptions to driving on the right side of the roadway:</p>

<ul>
<li>when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding 
in the same direction</li>
<li>when making a left turn</li>
<li>when the right half of a roadway is closed to traffic 
because of repair or construction</li>
<li>on a one-way street</li>
<li>when the roadway is of insufficient width</li>
<li>when the vehicle is necessarily traveling so slowly as to 
impede the normal movement of traffic, that portion of the 
highway adjacent to the right edge of the roadway may be 
utilized temporarily when conditions permit safe operation</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improper Turns</h4>

<p>An <em>intersection</em> is any place where two or more roadways 
meet or cross each other. Traffic engineers work hard to see that 
intersections are usable and safe, but sometimes they are hampered 
by geography or the complexity of the intersection itself. Even more 
so, intersections are made dangerous by overcrowding. Unfortunately, 
overcrowding and complexity are a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>In fact, for the purposes of defensive driving, you might think of 
an intersection as "an 'accident' waiting to happen." Intersections 
are the single most common place for a collision in city driving. 
And changing directions through an intersection is even more 
complicated than merely proceeding straight through. It helps 
to proceed carefully and slow down as necessary.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Left_Turns.jpg" alt="Left Turns">
<div class="caption">When making a left turn, start from the leftmost <br>
lane in your direction of travel and finish into <br>
any safe and open lane.</div>
</div>

<p>You will sometimes encounter dedicated turn lanes at an intersection. 
Make sure you are looking well ahead in traffic so you can position 
yourself in the lane appropriate for the maneuver you are about to make. 
It is inefficient—and dangerous—to change lanes within an 
intersection or to try to change lanes at the last minute.</p>

<p><strong>Left Turns</strong></p>

<p>Because of the considerable risk presented by a left turn, motorists 
must take extra care to remain aware of the entire intersection 
environment. From the gigantic truck that restricts your view of 
oncoming traffic to the speeder who comes barreling through the 
intersection with little regard for others, turning left at an 
intersection can be a hazardous experience. Stay alert! Keep in mind 
that it can take several seconds for your vehicle to cross lanes of 
traffic during a left turn, and time your maneuver accordingly.</p>

<p>To turn left, position your vehicle in the left-turn lane, or in 
the leftmost lane in your direction of travel if there is no dedicated 
left-turn lane. Always signal your turn, and continue signaling until 
the turn is complete. When it is safe to proceed, pull into the 
intersection, continuing to scan for pedestrians in the crosswalk; 
proceed slowly if any objects or other vehicles block your view. If 
you must stop momentarily within the intersection, keep your wheels 
straight in order to prevent your vehicle from being pushed into 
opposing traffic should you be rear-ended. Take care not to "cut short" 
the corner, and complete the turn into any safe and open lane in your 
direction of travel.</p>
<!--CVC 22100-->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Protected_Left.jpg" alt="Protected Left">
<div class="caption">A "protected" left turn.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Protected Left Turns.</strong> A turn is classified as a 
<em>protected turn</em> when a green arrow on the signal array alerts 
turning drivers that they may proceed with the right-of-way. The green 
arrow provides time for vehicles to clear the intersection with a 
(comparatively) safe left turn. Nothing truly protects you in the 
driving environment except for your own defensive driving skills, of 
course, so remain vigilant. Always be on the lookout for pedestrians 
and for traffic moving against the light; pull into the intersection 
slowly and proceed with care.</p>
<!--CVC 21451-->

<p><strong>Unprotected Left Turns.</strong> If you are faced with a 
circular green light rather than a green arrow, you will be making 
an unprotected turn, and you must yield to oncoming traffic prior to 
attempting the left turn. Proceed only when your path is clear and 
you can complete the turn safely and without interfering with the 
movement of oncoming vehicles.</p>
<!--CVC 21801-->

<p><strong>Right Turns</strong></p>

<p>Fortunately, right turns are not as problematic as left turns. The 
distance that needs to be traversed is shorter, and you won't have to 
contend with crossing lanes of vehicle traffic moving in the opposing 
direction. With that said, there are more than enough things to keep 
a driver's mind occupied while turning right. As always, keep your 
eyes moving as you approach and enter the intersection, and be prepared 
to respond to last-minute hazards.</p>

<p>When turning right, position your vehicle as close as practicable 
to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway, or within any lane 
designated for right turns. Check your mirrors and blind spot for 
bicyclists or pedestrians who might be along the side of the road. 
Always signal your turn, and continue signaling until you have 
completed the turn. Scan the intersection for hazards, including 
pedestrians in the crosswalks you'll be passing over, as well as for 
cross traffic proceeding against a traffic control device. When you 
have determined that the path is clear, accelerate slowly and turn 
into the far right-hand lane in your direction of travel.</p>
<!--CVC 22100-->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Right_Turns.jpg" alt="Right_Turns">
<div class="caption">When turning right, stay as far to the <br>
right as possible. Make the turn close <br>
to the curb.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Right-Turn-on-Red.</strong> After coming to a 
<em>complete</em> stop, vehicle traffic facing a steady circular red 
light may cautiously enter an intersection to make a right turn. A 
right-turn-on-red may be prohibited by signs, however, and traffic 
may <em>never</em> proceed against a red arrow signal. Furthermore, 
the right-of-way in any intersection belongs to pedestrians in the 
crosswalk and to vehicles traveling with the green light. Time your 
turn carefully so as not to interfere with those who have the 
right-of-way. (Note that you may also turn left-on-a-red if you are 
turning from a one-way street onto a one-way street, completing the 
turn into any safe and open lane in your direction of travel.)</p>
<!--CVC 21451-->

<p><strong>Bicycle Lanes.</strong> In some cases, a lane dedicated for 
use by bicyclists may be present along the right edge of the roadway. 
Drivers may legally cross bicycle lanes; and they are to enter a bike 
lane in preparation for a right turn, but they may not do so more than 
200 feet before the turn. Remember also that bicyclists <em>always</em> 
have the right-of-way in a bicycle lane.</p>
<!--CVC 21717-->

<p><strong>Simultaneous Turn Lanes</strong></p>

<p>At some intersections of multi-laned roadways, signs or painted 
arrows on the pavement may indicate that two adjacent lanes either 
may or must turn. If you are in a lane marked with an arrow, you may 
proceed through the intersection only in the direction(s) indicated by 
the arrow(s). When two adjacent lanes allow turning, be careful to 
maintain position in your lane throughout the turn. Carefully monitor 
the position of turning vehicles in the adjacent lanes as well. If 
either vehicle drifts, there is the potential for a side-swipe 
collision.</p>
<!--CVC 22100-->

<p><strong>U-Turns</strong></p>

<p>A <em>U-turn</em> is a maneuver that turns a vehicle upon a highway 
so as to proceed in the opposite direction. (Note that a three-point 
turn is considered a U-turn.) The danger of U-turns comes about because 
drivers must deal with traffic moving in <em>both directions</em> in 
order to complete the maneuver. We often recommend that drivers make 
use of alternatives, such as driving around the block or turning around 
in a driveway or parking lot.</p>

<p>There are locations where U-turns are always prohibited. Never 
attempt a U-turn in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>where a U-turn is prohibited by signage</li>
<li>on a one-way street</li>
<li>anywhere that you do not have an unobstructed view of 
the highway and traffic upon it for at least 200 feet in 
both directions</li>
<!--CVC 22105-->
<li>in a business district, except at an intersection or on 
a divided highway where an opening has been provided</li>
<!--CVC 22102-->
<li>in a residence district when another vehicle is approaching 
from either direction within 200 feet, except when movement of 
the approaching vehicle is regulated by an official traffic 
control device</li>
<!--CVC 22103-->
<li>in or in front of the driveway entrance or approaches to a 
fire station</li>
<!--CVC 22104-->
</ul>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/U-Turn.jpg" alt="U-Turn">
</div>

<p><strong>Executing a U-Turn.</strong> When preparing to make a U-turn, 
first make sure that it is safe and legal at your present location. 
Position your vehicle as close as practicable to the extreme left-hand 
edge of lanes usable by traffic moving in your original direction of 
travel, activate your turn signal, and re-check for approaching traffic. 
When the coast is clear, complete the turn. You will most likely 
complete a U-turn into the outside, or right-hand, lane traveling in 
the opposite direction (due to space constraints), but you may complete 
the turn into any open lane in your intended direction of travel.</p>

<h4>Violating Right-of-Way Rules</h4>

<p>We'll discuss right-of-way in detail later in this course. For now, 
it should suffice to note that it is obvious that a violation of the 
right-of-way rules could lead to a collision. If another user of the 
roadway does not behave as a driver anticipated, it's easy to see how 
actions based on that incorrect expectation can lead to trouble.</p>

<p>As we've noted many times, drivers must do everything they can 
to avoid a collision. If another user of the roadway "takes" the 
right-of-way when it "should have been yours," simply let the person 
go—and avoid a collision!</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Stop_Sign-Signal.jpg" alt="Stop Sign-Signal">
</div>

<h4>Violating Stop Signals and Signs</h4>

<p>Much as with violations of the right-of-way rules, a motorist 
disregarding traffic controls can create trouble in the driving 
environment. When another driver assumes—rightfully (though 
perhaps dangerously)—that you will stop at a stop sign or 
signal, your failure to do so can lead to an uncomfortably "close 
encounter"!</p>

<p>How long do you have to keep your vehicle still at a stop sign? 
Three seconds? Five? The answer is: The vehicle must remain stopped 
until it is safe to proceed. Come to a <em>full stop</em> and do not 
proceed until it is 100%, absolutely, positively safe for you to go 
without incident.</p>

<p>Always remember that the sign does say <em>stop</em>, after all, 
and not <em>slow down</em>. Common sense should tell us that we should 
actually stop! But…what constitutes "a full stop?" Drivers are 
not required to stop for any specific length of time, so how do you 
know when you've stopped "long enough" to avoid a citation? Law 
enforcement officers often look at a vehicle's wheels: If the wheels 
have stopped turning, the vehicle has, by definition, ceased its 
forward motion. Officers might also look for the front-end "dip," as 
the vehicle body briefly rocks forward with momentum after the chassis 
has come to a halt.</p>

<p>At stop signals, meanwhile, drivers are to bring the vehicle to a 
complete stop and remain stopped until the red light facing them has 
changed to green (barring a turn-on-red, as discussed above).</p>

<p>What law enforcement is looking for aside, the bottom line is that 
the safety of the driving environment is at stake when drivers ignore 
the literal interpretation of everyday laws. And it doesn't get much 
more literal or obvious than having to stop at a stop sign (or signal)!</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Fball_Coach.jpg" alt="Fball Coach">
<div class="caption">"You've got to keep your <br>
head in the game when <br>
you're driving!"</div>
</div>

<h4>Driver Distractions</h4>

<p>We'll have an expanded discussion of driver distractions later in 
this course. Driver distractions must be mentioned here, however, 
because they are a common cause of collisions. After all, it's hard for 
a driver to be aware of what's happening outside of the vehicle and to 
respond appropriately to hazards if that person is so preoccupied that 
he or she has no idea what's going on. Like your coach used to tell you, 
you've got to "keep your head in the game" when your operating a motor 
vehicle!</p>

<h3>Protecting Yourself in a Collision</h3>

<p>In <em>any</em> collision, your first line of defense is the 
vehicle's safety systems. Make sure they are operational and properly 
adjusted. Always wear your safety belt and make sure everyone else in 
the vehicle is appropriately restrained!</p>

<h4>Being Hit from the Rear</h4>

<p>When you are struck from the rear, you have two priorities: 
protecting your person, and keeping your vehicle from being pushed 
into oncoming or cross traffic. If you have time to prepare, shift the 
transmission into neutral (automatic transmission) or disengage the 
clutch (manual transmission) and ease up on the brake to allow the 
vehicle to absorb as much of the force of impact as possible. 
Immediately after the impact, brake hard to avoid being pushed into 
the flow of traffic. Having head rests in the proper position and in 
good working order will help to minimize whiplash injuries.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Collision_Evade.jpg" alt="Collision Evade">
</div>

<h4>Being Hit from the Side</h4>

<p>Attempt to steer away from the impact. (It's probably your natural 
reaction anyway!) After the impact, try to maintain as much control 
as possible over your vehicle in order to avoid a chain reaction of 
crashes. The worst injuries from side-impact collisions have been 
mitigated by side-panel air bags; if you are fortunate enough to have 
them, make sure they are in good working order. Bear in mind, however, 
that once an air bag deploys, your ability to control the vehicle may 
be compromised.</p>

<h4>Being Hit from the Front</h4>

<p>No collision is good, but the head-on is probably the worst. The 
forces generated are devastating. Being struck head-on at city 
driving speeds (generally 25 to 35 mph) is like driving into a brick 
wall at 50 to 70 mph—roughly equivalent to driving your vehicle 
off of an eight-story building! Unfortunately, there is very little 
you can do once your vehicle is actually struck head-on. Our best 
advice is to do everything you possibly can to avoid such a collision 
in the first place.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities Following a Collision</h3>

<p>Drivers tend to receive advice on how to behave at a collision scene 
from all sorts of sources. Unfortunately, dubious information only 
muddies the waters at a time when you can least afford to be confused. 
Fortunately, the rights and wrongs of how to handle yourself are fairly 
simple:</p>

<p>You <em>must</em> stop if you are involved in the collision. If you 
fail to do so, you can be charged with hit-and-run driving. As a matter 
of care and concern for others, you might also stop to see whether you 
can render assistance if you are the first passerby at the scene of 
any collision.</p>
<!-- CVC 20001 -->

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Crash_Icon.jpg" alt="Crash Icon"></div>

<h4>Give Aid to the Injured and Secure the Scene</h4>

<p>The first thing to do when stopping at the scene of a 
collision—either as a Good Samaritan or as an involved 
party—is to secure the scene. Take these actions whenever 
you can do so safely:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is very easy to cause more harm to injured persons by 
moving them, and you should not do so unless it is deemed 
absolutely necessary. You are advised to move injured victims 
away from areas that present an imminent danger, however: if 
they are in a vehicle that may catch fire or one that might 
be struck by following traffic or shift into a more dangerous 
position.</li>
<li>Provide first aid to the injured to the extent that you 
are able. Some conditions require immediate medical attention. 
If a victim is bleeding profusely, for instance, it is critical 
that the bleeding be stopped as quickly as possible. Other 
injuries, such as broken bones or soft tissue injuries, can be 
left to medical personnel. If inaction will likely lead to the 
death of the injured party, you should do what you are able; 
but unless you are a trained medical (para-)professional, there 
is obviously a limit to how much you can do.</li>
<ul>
<li>Bleeding may be stopped by elevating the bleeding body 
part and applying direct pressure to the wound.</li>
<li>If elevation and pressure do not stop the bleeding, 
you can try to tightly wrap the wound. Be careful not to 
entirely cut off circulation to the extremity, though, as 
this may result in tissue death.</li>
<li>Try to keep victims from going into shock. Keep them 
warm using whatever blankets or clothing are at hand. Also, 
it may be helpful to elevate certain portions of the 
victim's body. Remember the saying, "If the face is red, 
lift the head. If the face is pale, lift the tail [i.e., 
feet]."</li>
</ul>
<li>If someone has been seriously injured in the collision, 
call for emergency services. If you are unable to do so, ask a 
bystander to call for you.</li>
<li>Do what you can to remove from the roadway any debris that 
could present a serious hazard to following vehicles—but 
only if you can do so safely. If a vehicle is blocking the 
roadway but is drivable, move it to the side of the road. If 
a disabled vehicle is blocking the roadway, try to push it to 
the side. At a minimum, you can set out safety devices such as 
flares, cones, or warning triangles to alert approaching drivers 
of the hazard.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/EMT.jpg" alt="EMT">
</div>

<p>Once the scene of the collision is secure and any victims have 
received the necessary first aid, call 911 (if you have not already 
done so because of a critical injury). The 911 operator will contact 
all relevant assistance once the needs have been assessed.</p>

<h4>Exchanging Information</h4>

<p>Any time you are involved in a collision with another vehicle, you 
are required to stop and remain on the scene until the information 
which will allow law enforcement and insurance personnel to act has 
been exchanged. Note any damage and the details of the situation, and 
exchange with others:</p>

<ul>
<li>name, current address, and driver license number for all 
involved parties</li>
<li>vehicle registration number of all involved vehicles</li>
<li>insurance information, including relevant policy numbers 
and the insurance provider's name and phone number</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also want to obtain the names and contact information of any 
witnesses to the collision, just in case you need to get information 
from them later.</p>

<p>What would you do if someone who hit you said that they didn't have 
their license on them, but that they knew the number by heart? Call the 
police! Drivers must carry their license with them whenever they are 
operating a vehicle. Would you trust someone who had already failed 
to obey the law? As well, call for assistance under any unusual 
circumstances (e.g., an intoxicated, combative, uncooperative, 
unlicensed, or uninsured driver; involved parties threatening to 
leave the scene; vehicles blocking the roadway).</p>

<p>If you damage someone else's property with your vehicle and the 
owner is not in the immediate area, you are required to leave in an 
obvious place a brief note with your contact information and a 
description of the situation. You must also, without unnecessary 
delay, notify the police department or, if the collision occurred in 
unincorporated territory, the local headquarters of the California 
Highway Patrol.</p>
<!-- CVC 20002 -->

<p>Once you have fulfilled your duties at the scene of a collision, 
seek medical attention as necessary for any injuries. Then you can 
start thinking about paperwork: notifying your insurance agent and law 
enforcement, as necessary.</p>

<h4>Reporting Requirements</h4>

<p>Drivers who are involved in a collision may be required to file 
reports regarding the incident:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Law Enforcement:</strong> The driver of a vehicle 
involved in any collision resulting in injury or death to 
another person must, within 24 hours, make a written report 
of the collision to the California Highway Patrol (or, if the 
collision occurred within a city, to either the highway patrol 
or the local police department).</li>
<li><strong>The DMV:</strong> Drivers are required to file a 
report with the Department of Motor Vehicles within 10 days 
if they are involved in a collision that results in injury 
or death, or in which more than $1,000 in property damage was 
sustained by any one person.</li>
</ul>

<div class="caption">You may have to file a few reports <br>
if you're involved in a collision.</div>
</div>

<p>Your insurance company may file a collision report for you, but an 
insurance company is only a broker. The responsibility to make sure that 
the proper reports are filed rests with <em>you</em>—the driver. 
If you fail to file a required collision report, your driver license 
will be suspended until the report is filed. If you are physically 
incapable of making a required collision report, any occupant of the 
vehicle at the time of the collision may file a report for you.</p>

<p>Collision reports are confidential, but the information may be 
released to parties directly involved in the incident. The reports are 
intended to be used by the DMV and CHP for statistical analysis, and 
may not be entered into evidence at any trial.</p>

<h2>Aggressive Driving and Road Rage</h2>

<h3>Aggressive Driving</h3>

<p>Aggressive driving has been recognized as a problem for as long as 
motor vehicles have been on the road. As early as 1915, driving manuals 
were noting that "some automobiles abuse their rights and heedlessly 
run over the rights of others." This is a good, broad definition of 
aggressive driving, some of the symptoms of which are: following too 
closely (tailgating); driving excessively fast; weaving through traffic; 
ignoring traffic signs and signals; and passing under unsafe conditions.</p>

<p>It seems that all of these behaviors are on the increase, and perhaps 
they are. The reasons for increased aggression on the road are many, 
but the most compelling seems to be simply that there are more vehicles 
choking our roadways. Ever more drivers crowding an increasing number 
of roads leads to greater congestion. All of these things goad 
frustrated drivers into unsafe maneuvers and urge "control freaks" to 
attempt to exert power over situations beyond their control. The irony 
is that dangerous, aggressive driving behaviors actually inject more 
unpredictability and fear into the driving environment. These in turn 
lead to hesitation, which—you guessed it—creates still more 
congestion and delays!</p>

</div> -->


<h3>Road Rage</h3>

<p>In the driving environment, road rage is the ultimate 
"anti-courtesy." More specifically, however, <em>The American Heritage 
Dictionary</em> defines <em>road rage</em> as, "Violent behavior 
exhibited by drivers in traffic, often as a manifestation of stress." 
Road rage refers to the threat or conscious attempt to injure or kill 
another user of the roadway as a result of a driving-related 
altercation. It requires willful disregard for the safety of others. 
Road rage incidents are classified as criminal offenses, and they 
often begin with episodes of aggressive driving, either by the 
perpetrator or by the victim.</p>

<p>Nobody really has a handle on who is likely to be the perpetrator 
of a road rage incident. There are studies that indicate that certain 
types of people are susceptible to road rage. Other studies suggest 
that road rage is situational. And, in fact, road rage has been known 
to overcome drivers with no prior history of violence. One theory 
has it that those most susceptible to road rage see driving as an 
expression of themselves as individuals rather than as an activity. 
Thus, small mistakes by other drivers are taken as personal affronts 
that need to be avenged. Regardless of the frequency, the underlying 
cause, or the psychological profiles of the parties involved, a road 
rage incident is extremely dangerous and should be avoided at all 
costs!</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Angry_Man.jpg" alt="Angry Man">
</div>

<p>Because of the grave danger that road rage presents, the State of 
California is very serious about the punishment for such violations. 
Drivers convicted for a road rage incident will have their license 
suspended for six months for a first offense and for one year for a 
second or subsequent offense. The suspension begins from the time of 
the driver's conviction or upon his or her release from confinement 
or prison, at the discretion of the court. Drivers may, in lieu of or 
in addition to suspension, be required to complete a court-approved 
anger management or road rage course.</p>

<h3>Handling Aggressive/Raging Drivers</h3>

<p>If an aggressive driver victimizes you, do not engage him or her. 
Aggressive drivers are often subliminally angry, and they may consider 
any engagement as provocation to escalate the conflict. Don't make eye 
contact. Remember your training, stay calm, and drive blissfully on.</p>

<p>If you find another driver pursuing you on the highway, honking his 
or her horn at you, trying to cut you off, or waving or shouting, do not 
stop. The American Automobile Association offers the following advice 
for handling a road rage incident:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are being hassled by another driver,…</li>
<ul>
<li>try not to react.</li>
<li>avoid making eye contact.</li>
<li>don't be tempted to accelerate, brake, or swerve 
suddenly.</li>
<li><em>any</em> acknowledgment could be interpreted as 
confrontation.</li>
</ul>
<li>If a driver continues to harass you, or if you think you are 
being followed, drive to the nearest police station or a busy 
place to get help.</li>
<li>In the city, lock your car doors and keep the windows and 
sunroof only partly open.</li>
<li>When stopped in traffic, leave enough space to pull out 
from behind the car you are following.</li>
<li>If someone tries to get into your car, attract attention by 
sounding your horn or a personal alarm.</li>
<li>Do not be tempted to start a fight. And do not be tempted 
to carry any sort of weapon, as it may only provoke a potential 
assailant and could end up in his or her hands.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Psychologist.jpg" alt="Psychologist">
</div>

<h3>Keeping Your Own Emotions in Check</h3>

<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA), aggressive driving is often preceded by a stage known as 
<em>road negativity</em>. Some drivers have a negative attitude about 
the driving environment before they even slide behind the wheel. They 
have negative thoughts and expectations about everything, from the 
amount of traffic they are likely to encounter to the poor driving 
habits of other drivers to the weather and the condition of the roadways 
that they will be traveling upon. In addition, these negative drivers 
often have a negative perception of law enforcement and traffic laws. 
Because of their negative attitudes they are primed to become upset at 
the slightest provocation; and their emotions tend to control their 
behavior. They will probably speed, tailgate, and weave in and out 
of traffic. They will get upset over the behavior of other drivers, 
believing that these drivers somehow have something against them 
personally. They become agitated over heavy traffic and delays caused 
by road construction. They get angry with drivers who obey speed 
limits or block their lane of travel, but feel challenged by anyone 
who drives faster than they do. In short, they're frustrated and 
infuriated by <em>everything</em> that they encounter behind the 
wheel!</p>

<p>Don't let road negativity get the better of you before you even 
get going! Always remember that traffic laws exist for the safety of 
all users of the driving environment. And don't forget that courtesy, 
politeness, and patience always improve a situation—while 
aggressive maneuvers and a hostile attitude only make things worse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Impatience, hurrying, stress, and irritation—sometimes at 
things that are totally unrelated to driving—are all major factors 
leading to unsafe driving behaviors. As frustration and anger levels 
increase, concern for fellow motorists plummets. Keep these simple 
reminders in mind when you need to reign in your emotions:</p>

<ul>
<li>	Be polite and courteous at all times—even when others 
are not.</li>
<li>Reduce driving stress by allowing enough time to get where 
you are going and by researching, prior to your trip, the best 
routes to take.</li>
<li>Always obey speed limits, traffic controls, and other 
traffic regulations.</li>
<li>Don't follow other drivers too closely or cut them off.</li>
<li>Don't drive slowly in the left ("fast") lane.</li>
<li>Concentrate on driving—not on the stereo, mobile phone, 
passengers, or other distractions.</li>
<li>Know that you cannot control traffic, but you can control 
how you react.</li>
<li>Never take other drivers' actions personally.</li>
<li>In difficult situations, ask yourself, "Could the other 
driver have made a simple mistake?"</li>
<li>Resist the temptation to "teach the other driver a 
lesson."</li>
</ul>

<h4>Treat Others the Way You'd Like to Be Treated</h4>

<p>Watching drivers on the highway, it is not uncommon to see motorists, 
with great annoyance, expressing displeasure at the other drivers around 
them. All the while they become more and more aggravated at being in an 
uncontrollable position.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Golden_Rule.jpg" alt="Golden Rule">
<div class="caption"><strong>The Golden Rule of Driving:</strong> <br>
Drive unto others as you would <br>
have them drive unto you.</div>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, all of this negative energy is…well, negative. 
Instead, put yourself in the shoes—or, in the driver's seat, as it 
were—of the motorists around you. By doing so, you can develop the 
empathy needed to react appropriately. You should behave toward other 
motorists as you would toward members of your community at a public 
gathering. Respectful actions help to encourage and strengthen a 
courteous attitude toward others behind the wheel by setting a positive 
example. A good rule of thumb is to be as polite on the road as you 
would be at a birthday party—where very little sulking, screaming, 
or pushing and shoving is experienced.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Driving aggressively and getting 
involved in a road rage incident are dangerous—potentially 
deadly—scenarios that are all-too-common on our roadways. Do your 
part as a defensive driver and keep yourself under control when you're 
behind the wheel!</p>

<h3>Anatomy of a Road Rage Incident</h3>

<p>The following description of a road rage incident is from 
congressional testimony on aggressive driving by Dr. Leon James, 
Professor of Psychology at the University of Hawaii. This analysis of 
a tragedy was delivered to the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation 
and Infrastructure, U.S. House of Representatives (Washington, D.C.), 
on July 17, 1997. The recounted incident is true.</p>

A 24-year-old mother of two from Cincinnati, driving alone 
in a Grand Am, is following a woman driving in a 
Volkswagen. In front of them are several cars behind a 
truck going 35 mph. The Grand Am pulls into the left lane 
in order to pass and accelerates up to 55 mph.</div></td>
<td><div align="left">Overtaking a line of vehicles is 
always risky. You must expect that other drivers in the 
line also want to break away, so don't speed up excessively.
<br><br>
<strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Pull into the passing 
lane and increase speed moderately, in case the 
overtaken driver pulls out in front of you. Defensive 
driving requires that you restrain yourself and 
accommodate others' movements.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="300"><div align="left"><strong>Step 2:</strong> 
The VW suddenly pulls out into the left lane in front of 
the Grand Am, going 20 mph slower and forcing the driver 
of the Grand Am to apply the brakes suddenly.</div></td>
<td><div align="left">This provocative maneuver creates 
a dangerous situation. Trial records indicate this was 
done deliberately to "punish" the Grand Am driver for 
tailgating. It's an aggressive act, in direct opposition 
to another driver already engaged in a maneuver.
<br><br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Avoid engaging in power 
struggles with other drivers. Back down from challenges, 
be less competitive, and facilitate rather than oppose 
the actions of other drivers.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="300"><div align="left"><strong>Step 3:</strong> 
The VW gradually overtakes the slow truck, passes it, 
and pulls back into the right lane.</div></td>
<td><div align="left">This is a proper maneuver, but 
doesn't by itself defuse the power struggle that is in 
progress.
<br><br>
<strong>Alternative 3:</strong> Be prepared to pacify 
hurt feelings. It takes tools of self-regulation to 
remain calm in the face of a potential backlash. It 
is possible that other drivers will retaliate against 
such provocative moves.</div></td>

can do is openly duel with another driver. She uses all

Resist the temptation to teach other drivers a lesson.

inner power to resist the impulse to retaliate.</div></td>

non-confrontational posture and rationally predict the 
consequences of road rage.</div></td>

<td width="300"><div align="left"><strong>Step 6:</strong> 
The Grand Am now tries to pull ahead in the left lane 
in order to re-enter the right lane, but the VW 
accelerates and blocks the way.</div></td>
<td><div align="left">The die is cast for a tragedy, 
with both drivers locking themselves into a pathological 
game.

you are in an insane power struggle that you instantly 
need to abandon. This takes self-witnessing to help 
you realize how far gone you are emotionally.</div></td>

The Grand Am slows down and pulls in behind the VW, but 
keeps up the pressure by tailgating dangerously.</div></td>

back off momentarily, but she hasn't calmed down. She 
chooses to escalate the fight.

<strong>Alternative 7:</strong> Use a lull in the fight 
to calm down and pacify the other driver by not 
appearing hostile. You need to train yourself to be 
able to back out of a fight by practicing "an attitude 
of latitude" or forgiveness.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="300"><div align="left"><strong>Step 8:</strong> 
Now the Grand Am suddenly pulls out into the left lane 
again, overtakes and cuts off the VW, then gives the

to wage war. She's no longer just getting even. She 
started out by getting upset that the VW driver almost 
caused an accident, but then ended up creating a major 
battle on the highway.

<strong>Alternative 8:</strong> Realize that the law of 
escalation exacts tragedy. This takes an overhaul of 
the aggressive driver's personality and driving 
philosophy.</div></td>

<h2>Driver Distractions</h2>

<p>Driver distractions have joined alcohol and speeding as leading 
factors in vehicle crashes. In a recent study by the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Virginia Tech 
Transportation Institute, researchers cited some form of driver 
distraction within three seconds prior to the event as a factor in 
nearly 80% of collisions and 65% of near-collisions. The real tragedy 
is that most distractions are self-inflicted, easily avoidable, and 
completely unnecessary.</p><!-- http://www.nhtsa.gov/Driving+Safety/Distracted+Driving+at+Distraction.gov/Breakthrough+Research+on+Real-World+Driver+Behavior+Released (accessed 11/19/2014). -->

<p>Driving involves constant and complex coordination between your 
mind and body. Any object or event that prevents you from operating 
your vehicle safely is a <em>distraction</em>. There are three types 
of distractions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Visual</strong> distractions take your eyes off 
of the road.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive</strong> distractions take your mind 
off of the road.</li>
<li><strong>Manual</strong> distractions take your hands off 
of the steering wheel.</li>
</ul>

<p>The trick to handling distractions is understanding that they are 
<em>everywhere</em>—both inside and outside of the vehicle. A 
banner announcing a sale at the local furniture store can distract 
a driver just as easily as a spilled beverage or an incoming text 
message. Some activities require our <em>full attention</em>, whether 
we like it or not. Driving is one of those activities. Stay attuned 
to the task at hand when you're behind the wheel. After all, 
distractions are only distracting if you allow them to be. Your safety 
and the safety of the driving community depend on your willingness to 
suspend all other tasks which might interfere with your ability to 
safely operate a motor vehicle.</p>

<h3>The Myth of Multitasking</h3>

<p>"Multitasking" is highly valued in today's culture, where it seems 
the push for increased productivity has become an all-consuming 
passion. People often <em>think</em> they are effectively accomplishing 
two (or more) tasks at the same time when they attempt to multitask. 
While multitaskers may <em>appear</em> to work on tasks simultaneously, 
however, scientific research has exposed contradictions to this common 
belief:</p>

<ul>
<li>People do not actually multitask.</li>
<li>People do not accomplish either task with optimal focus 
and effectiveness when they try to multitask.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Now_Serving.jpg" alt="Now Serving">
</div>

<p>Human brains do not perform two (or more) tasks at the same time. 
Instead, our brains handle tasks sequentially, switching between one 
task and another. Brains can juggle tasks very rapidly, which leads 
us to erroneously believe we are doing two tasks at the same time. 
But in reality, the brain is switching attention between tasks and 
performing only one task at a time.</p>

<p>The brain not only juggles tasks, it also juggles focus and 
attention. When people attempt to perform two cognitively complex 
tasks, such as operating a motor vehicle and holding a telephone 
conversation, the brain shifts its focus between them. Important 
information falls away and is not processed by the brain. But 
because people are not aware of what they miss, it's virtually 
impossible for them to realize when they are mentally taking on 
too much. Frighteningly, the implication of these findings is that 
motorists may devote all of their attention to driving one moment, 
but give driving only part of their attention—or <em>none</em> 
of it—the next. That's a recipe for disaster!</p>

<p>We can safely walk while chewing gum in a city crowded with motor 
vehicles, light poles, sign posts, and other hazards. That's because 
one of those tasks, chewing gum, is not a very demanding activity. 
People do not perform as well when trying to execute two 
attention-demanding tasks at the same time. Research shows that even 
pedestrians don't effectively monitor their environment for safety 
when they talk on a mobile phone. Now imagine talking on the phone 
and engaging in a task far more cognitively demanding than walking: 
driving a motor vehicle. The challenge is managing two tasks that 
are highly demanding of our cognitive attention.</p>

<!--<p>Brains may face a "bottleneck" in which different regions of the 
brain must pull from shared and limited resources for seemingly 
unrelated tasks, constraining the mental resources available for those 
tasks. Research shows that even when different cognitive tasks draw 
on two different regions of the brain, we can still have performance 
problems when trying to perform two tasks at the same time. This may 
help to explain why talking on the phone could affect what a driver 
sees. Two usually unrelated tasks compete for our brain's information 
processing resources and increase our cognitive workload.</p>-->

<p>A high information processing workload brings the highest risk 
when unexpected driving hazards arise. Under most conditions, 
motorists are performing well-practiced, automatic driving tasks. 
For example, without thinking too much about it, drivers slow down 
when they see yellow or red signal lights, and activate turn signals 
when intending to turn or change lanes. Staying within a lane, noting 
speed limit and other street signs, and checking mirrors are also 
automatic tasks for most experienced drivers. People can easily and 
safely handle these driving tasks with an average cognitive workload. 
Further complicating the issue is that, during the vast majority of 
road trips, nothing bad happens (and that is as it should be); but 
that fact can lead people to feel a false sense of security and 
competency. Drivers may believe they can safely multitask. But drivers 
must always be prepared to respond to the unexpected.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Man_Blindfolded.jpg" alt="Man Blindfolded">
<div class="caption"><em>Inattentional blindness</em> <br>
occurs when you "look" <br>
but don't "see."</div>
</div>

<h4>The Results of Multitasking</h4>

<p><strong>Inattentional Blindness</strong></p>

<p>Vision is the most important sense for driving. But drivers who 
are distracted can experience what is known as <em>inattentional 
blindness</em>: they have a tendency to "look at" but not "see" 
objects around them. Estimates indicate that motorists using mobile 
phones fail to perceive up to 50% of the information in their 
driving environment. They look out the windshield but do not process 
everything necessary to effectively monitor their surroundings, 
identify potential hazards, and respond in an appropriate manner 
to unexpected situations.</p>

<p><strong>Slowed Reaction Times</strong></p>

<p>Brain researchers have identified <em>reaction-time switching 
costs</em>, measurable quantities of time during which the brain is 
switching its attention and focus from one task to another. Longer 
reaction times are a natural outcome of the brain's switching focus, 
and this negatively impacts driving performance. For every 
information input, the brain must make many decisions: whether to act 
on the perception data, how to act, when to execute a response, and 
when to stop that action. While the whole process may take only a 
fraction of a second, all of the steps do take time—and 
fractions of seconds can mean the difference between a crash or no 
crash, injury or no injury, life or death. Think it's not a big deal? 
A University of Utah driving simulator study found drivers using 
mobile phones exhibited slower reaction times than drivers impaired 
by alcohol at 0.08% BAC!</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty Staying in a Lane</strong></p>

<p><em>Lane keeping</em> is a driver's ability to maintain the vehicle 
within a lane of traffic. When driving at roadway and freeway speeds 
with vehicles spaced just a few feet from each other in parallel lanes, 
the margin of error for decision-making and crash avoidance is very 
small. Moreover, drivers who create a hazard by straying from their 
lanes depend on other drivers around them to drive defensively and 
respond appropriately. If those other drivers are distracted as well, 
the risk is compounded and the situation can end in catastrophe.</p>

<h4>Reducing the Risk</h4>

<p>There are indications that the public is generally aware of the 
risks of distracted driving. In a survey by the AAA Foundation for 
Traffic Safety, 83% of respondents rated mobile phone use by drivers 
as a "serious" or "extremely serious" problem. In this survey, phone 
use was rated as a serious or extremely serious problem more often 
than aggressive driving, excessive speeding, and running red lights; 
only alcohol-impaired driving was rated as a serious problem by more 
respondents. Despite their stated belief in the dangers, however, 
more than half of the same survey respondents said that they had 
talked on a mobile phone while driving during the previous 30 days, 
and 17% admitted to doing so "often" or "very often."</p>

<p>Furthermore, because of how our brains process information, we 
are never aware of the information that gets filtered out in 
distracted situations. This may add to our lack of awareness of our 
own limitations. Research shows that distracted drivers may not be 
aware of the effects of cognitive distraction during mobile phone 
use while driving. Drivers felt that they were safer drivers when 
phoning hands-free, but actually showed <em>decreased</em> 
performance while using hands-free phones. One study found drivers 
who thought the task was easy tended to perform the worst.</p>
<!--National Safety Council, White Paper: "Understanding the Distracted Brain," March 2010.-->

<p>Don't let the myth of multitasking—and it is just that, a 
myth—turn you into an unsafe motorist. When you operate a 
motor vehicle, you are already "multitasking": drivers must perform 
a number of overlapping tasks. Be proactive and stay safe on the 
road. Avoid distractions when you're behind the wheel.</p>

<h3>Inside-the-Vehicle Distractions</h3>

<h4>Talking and Texting</h4>

<p>In California, it is against the law for an adult driver to use a 
mobile telephone unless it is specifically designed and configured to 
allow hands-free listening and talking, and is used in that manner while 
operating a motor vehicle. This rule does not apply to those times when 
the device is used for emergency purposes (such as to contact an emergency 
services agency), or to a person driving a motor vehicle on private 
property. Exemptions are also made for emergency services personnel who 
are performing their duties. Drivers of school buses and other transit 
vehicles are prohibited from using a mobile communications device for 
personal use while they are on-duty.</p>
<!--CVC 23123, 23125-->

<p>Adult drivers are further prohibited from driving while holding and 
operating a handheld wireless telephone or an electronic wireless 
communications device unless the device is specifically designed and 
configured to allow fully voice-operated and hands-free operation and 
is used in that manner while driving. Such devices may be operated in 
a manner requiring the use of the driver's hand <em>only</em> if the 
device is mounted/affixed in a lower corner of the windshield or to 
the dashboard or center console in a manner that does not hinder the 
driver's view of the road, and if the driver can activate or deactivate 
a feature or function with a single swipe or tap. (Allowed windshield 
placement is similar to a GPS unit: a 7-inch square in the lower corner 
on the passenger's side, or a 5-inch square in the lower corner on the 
driver's side, and outside of an air bag deployment zone.)</p>
<!--CVC 23123.5 (incl. CVC 26708(a)(12))-->

<p>Drivers under the age of 18 are prohibited <em>at all times</em> 
from using <em>any</em> wireless telephone or other electronic wireless 
communications device while driving. (Again, the law provides exceptions 
for using a device for emergency purposes.)</p>
<!--CVC 23124-->

<p>Any driver found guilty of a second violation for handheld use of a 
wireless communications device within 36 months of a prior conviction 
for the same offense will have a point assessed to their driving record.</p>
<!-- CVC 23810.3 -->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Cell_Driver.jpg" alt="Cell Driver">
</div>

<p>Even though driving while phoning hands-free is legal for adults, 
it's still dangerous. Researchers have found that it's not just the 
holding of the phone that distracts drivers, it's the phone 
conversation itself. Hands-free devices are often seen as a solution 
to the risks of mobile phone use while driving because they help 
to eliminate two obvious risks—visual (looking away from the 
road) and manual (removing your hands from the steering wheel). 
However, hands-free devices do nothing to eliminate the cognitive 
distraction (taking your mind off of the road). Avoid making calls 
while you're driving; and if you receive a call, just let it go to 
voice-mail.</p>

<p>The study by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found that 
reaching for an electronic device, dialing a mobile phone, and 
holding a phone conversation increased the risk of a collision. Not 
surprisingly, however, it was <em>texting</em> that caused the real 
problems. The study found that truckers who text message while 
driving are <em>23 times</em> more likely to crash or to get into a 
near-wreck than undistracted drivers. The reasons are obvious: Good 
luck paying attention to the road when you've got your head down, 
staring at the display of your phone, while mentally composing a 
message and manipulating a tiny keyboard!</p>

<p>Internet surfing, e-mailing, and checking voice-mail are, likewise, 
dangerous activities that divert drivers' hands, eyes, and minds from 
the driving task. Take a break from these chores while you're driving, 
and take care of them in other settings.</p>

<h4>Other Electronics</h4>

<p>Any sort of handheld device can take your eyes off of the road 
and your hands from the wheel. But dashboard devices can distract 
just as easily. Nonetheless, today's vehicles can come equipped 
with an incredible array of built-in electronics. Some serve merely 
to entertain, but others are actually helpful in the course of 
vehicle operation.</p>

<p><strong>Instrument Panel</strong></p>

<p>We've encouraged you to glance down at your instrument panel from 
time to time while driving. The instrument panel is where your 
speedometer is located, after all, and it contains other useful gauges 
and warning lights that keep you informed of the status of various 
vehicle systems. It's important to be mindful of all of these things, 
of course. But you must remember that diverting your attention to the 
instrument panel for any length of time removes your eyes and your 
thoughts from the driving environment, leaving you unable to respond 
in a timely manner to any hazards that might appear suddenly and 
unexpectedly. Adjust vehicle controls before you start driving, and 
periodically take short glances at the instrument panel to stay 
properly informed.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/One-Man_Show.jpg" alt="One-Man Show">
<div class="caption">Don't "multitask" while you're driving. <br>
No eating. No grooming. No phoning. <br>
No fooling!</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Navigation Systems</strong></p>

<p>Navigation systems—either stand-alone units or those 
embedded in the dashboard—can keep you from getting lost and 
can help you to avoid the stress and frustration of finding your 
way to an unfamiliar destination. They can also present a 
tremendous distraction if you try to program or reset them while you 
are driving. Program your destination into your navigation system 
<em>before</em> you set out. If the unit must be reprogrammed after 
you've hit the road, have a passenger handle the task, or pull out of 
traffic and stop at a safe place (e.g., near the curb where parking 
is allowed or a parking lot or rest stop—<em>not</em> the 
shoulder of the freeway). This sage advice applies to paper maps as 
well: Don't become so absorbed with your navigation materials that 
you forget to pay attention to where you're actually driving!</p>

<p><strong>Entertainment Systems</strong></p>

<p>The vast majority of the information needed to safely operate a 
motor vehicle is obtained visually. Hearing is still an important 
sense for the driver, however, and the law forbids a person operating 
a motor vehicle or bicycle from wearing a headset covering, earplugs 
in, or earphones covering, resting on, or inserted in, both ears. 
(Exemptions are made for prosthetic hearing aids, for emergency 
services personnel, and for situations that require the use of a 
headset or earplugs for safety purposes.) You will also be able to 
better maintain your focus if you keep the volume of entertainment 
systems set at a reasonable level. It is unlawful for a driver to 
operate any sound amplification system so that it is audible outside 
of the vehicle for more than 50 feet.</p>
<!-- CVC 27400; CVC 27007 -->

<p>Many newer vehicles come equipped with audio system controls 
mounted on the steering wheel. These will help you to keep your 
hands on the wheel, but you can still be visually and cognitively 
distracted by your efforts to adjust the entertainment system. You 
may enjoy your music a great deal, but it's not critical for the 
operation of your vehicle. Have a passenger play DJ; or, if you 
need to adjust things yourself, wait until you have an opportunity 
to do so safely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it should probably go without saying that you shouldn't 
be watching television while you're driving. Taking your eyes off of 
the road long enough to enjoy your favorite television program or the 
latest blockbuster constitutes a major departure from the safe 
operation of your vehicle. Nonetheless, the law specifically prohibits 
the use of a monitor capable of displaying a television or video signal 
when the material displayed is visible to the driver while operating the 
vehicle. Vehicle information displays, navigation systems, and vehicle 
periphery safety devices (e.g., back-up camera displays) are allowed, 
but should always be used safely, sparingly, and as intended when you're 
on the road.</p>
<!--CVC 27602-->

<h4>Personal Hygiene</h4>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Freshen_Up.jpg" alt="Freshen Up">
<div class="caption" style="padding-left:40px"><em>Not</em> while you're driving!</div>
</div>

<p>We encourage everyone to engage in good hygiene practices. Brush 
your teeth, shower, wash your hair and style it in an attractive 
manner. But when you're in the driver's seat, getting cleaned up 
shouldn't trump safe vehicle operation. Unbelievably, it's not 
uncommon to see motorists cruising down the roadway…</p>

<ul>
<li>combing or brushing their hair.</li>
<li>brushing or flossing their teeth.</li>
<li>applying make-up or shaving.</li>
<li>clipping, filing, or polishing their nails.</li>
<li>putting in contact lenses or using eye drops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these tasks require some measure of precision, and the 
person performing them must pay close attention to what they're doing. 
Of course, as we've noted before, if you're paying attention to 
something other than the driving environment while operating a motor 
vehicle, you're not driving safely. Make the time to take care of 
personal hygiene before you climb behind the wheel or once you've 
reached your destination.</p>

<h4>Food and Drink</h4>

<p>In our go-go-go modern world, it's become increasingly common for 
us to grab a meal whenever and wherever we can. Often, this means 
choking down fast food and slurping a beverage while driving to our 
next appointment. Unfortunately, it's not necessarily healthy to eat 
that way, and it's certainly not safe to drive that way!</p>

<p>If you're eating in your vehicle while driving, you are focusing on 
your food and not on your driving. It's not just that you're chewing 
and swallowing. You're also opening packages, unwrapping and re-wrapping 
food, reaching, leaning, spilling, wiping, and cleaning yourself or your 
vehicle. These are quite a number of distractions for one driver on one 
trip! It's far better to stop in a safe place to eat or drink. Allow 
yourself plenty of time to stop, rest from driving, and enjoy your meal.</p>

and beverages to eat and drink while you're driving.<br/><br/>

<span class="tran_voice">BACK TO STEVE</span><br/><br/>

Okay. What do all these foods have in common? They're messy! It's 
not the eating of the food that's necessarily the problem. It's 
the reacting after it falls into your lap. Did you know most 
food-related crashes happen in the morning when you're on the way to 
school or on the way to work, and you spill something on your nice, 
clean clothes and you don't want to spend the rest of the day with 
a big ugly spot on your pants or your dress. So, dashboard diners, 
keep it in the kitchen.</p>
</div> -->


<h4>Passengers, Pets, and Possessions</h4>

<p>What do children, friends, pets, and personal possessions have in 
common? They can all be dangerous distractions to you while you're 
driving!</p>

<p>Children are neither old enough nor experienced enough to understand 
the responsibilities of safe motor vehicle operation. Teach young 
children that driving is an important job and that you must concentrate 
when you're behind the wheel. For their own safety—and to keep 
them out of your personal space while you're driving—always 
properly buckle up your children. Provide them with books, games, or 
other appropriate toys to occupy their attention during trips. If you 
need to attend to your children, pull over to a safe place. Don't try 
to handle children while you're driving.</p>

<p>Similarly, a loose pet in a moving vehicle can be very dangerous. 
As when driving with children, you should properly secure your pet. 
Use an appropriately sized pet carrier or portable kennel, or (better 
still) a specially designed pet harness. Never allow your pet to sit 
in your lap while you're driving a vehicle. An unrestrained pet can 
become a deadly projectile in the event of a sudden stop or crash, 
causing serious injury (even death) to the animal itself or to other 
vehicle occupants.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Best_Friend.jpg" alt="Best Friend">
</div>

<p>Don't let dogs ride with their heads hanging out of the window, 
even if they're restrained. If a restraint allows a dog to hang its 
head out of the window, it's an indication that the restraint may 
not sufficiently protect the animal from injury in a sudden stop or 
collision. Also, dogs who hang their heads out of a window are at 
risk of injury to their eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and face from 
airborne debris. (Also remember that, as with children, leaving a 
pet unattended in a vehicle can be harmful or even 
deadly—especially in warmer weather.)</p>

<p>When driving with friends and relatives, establish some strategies 
to keep your passengers under control. A carload of friends can be 
very distracting with boisterous conversation, quarrelling over music 
selections, or horseplay. Arguments and other serious conversations 
should be held in a safe, appropriate place—not from the 
driver's seat.</p>

<p>Finally, something as small and seemingly harmless as a plastic 
water bottle could become a lethal missile if it's traveling through 
the air at a speed of 30 mph after a car crash. Pack items that you 
won't need immediately in the cargo area of your vehicle, and leave 
at home things you won't need on your current trip (which will help 
to improve fuel economy as well). Use the glove compartment and 
console storage to hold personal items, such as mobile phones, 
sunglasses, garage door remotes, etc. And don't reach for the glove 
compartment or fish for dropped items while you're driving. Pull 
over and stop in a safe place before reaching to pick something up 
from the floor.</p>

<br>

<p>Use these quick tips to avoid distractions inside of your vehicle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restrain pets and children before setting out, and set 
ground rules for passengers to keep noise and activity to a 
reasonable level.</li>
<li>Safely stow cargo that's in the passenger compartment. It 
can be hazardous to try to corral loose items while you're 
driving—and, worse still, these articles could become 
dangerous projectiles in the event of a collision or sudden 
stop.</li>
<li>Set the vehicle's controls (seat position, mirrors, radio, 
climate controls, etc.) as soon as you get into the vehicle 
and before you begin driving. Take advantage of normal stops 
to adjust the radio, climate controls, navigation system, 
etc., or ask a passenger to adjust them for you.</li>
<li>Don't send text messages or talk on your mobile phone. 
The latest gossip or that business call might seem important 
to you at the time, but the only thing that's important while 
you're behind the 
wheel is driving safely.</li>
<li>Not to sound too much like your supervisor, but…a 
key to avoiding inside-the-vehicle distractions is time 
management. If you find yourself grooming/applying make-up, 
eating, or reading as you drive, free up more time at home or 
at the office for those activities. Check your voice-mail and 
finish your e-mailing, text messaging, and Web browsing before 
you begin driving.</li>
<li>Avoid smoking in your vehicle. Dropped smoking materials 
are the number one cause of vehicle fires, not to mention a 
serious distraction.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Any time you find yourself distracted 
by a situation in your vehicle that cannot be brought under control 
very quickly, pull out of traffic and deal with the distraction from 
a safe place!</p>

<h3>Outside-the-Vehicle Distractions</h3>

<p>Distractions don't come just from inside the vehicle. Objects 
or activities <em>outside</em> of the vehicle can unduly divert 
motorists' attention from the driving task as well. Separating 
critical information within the environment from non-critical 
information is a matter of practice and experience. Train yourself 
to focus on the task at hand and filter out the chaos.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Billboard.jpg" alt="Billboard">
</div>

<p>Common outside-the-vehicle distractions can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a collision scene</li>
<li>a vehicle stopped by law enforcement</li>
<li>construction work</li>
<li>a billboard advertisement</li>
<li>business signs</li>
<li>a crowd of people</li>
<li>beautiful scenery</li>
<li>street names and addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>It's okay to note these sights and events; you don't have to 
emotionlessly ignore them. In fact, defensive drivers will keep 
their eyes moving and be aware of the entire driving environment and 
everything in it. Any of these items could potentially turn into a 
hazard, after all. Just don't fixate so obsessively on any one thing 
that you lose "the big picture."</p>

<p>The most frequent cause of collisions, as far as <em>most</em> 
drivers are concerned, is…other drivers. Those "other drivers" 
may not cause as many crashes as we'd like to think they do. But, if 
it's true that we tend to think others are responsible, it's reasonable 
to ask why we don't take more care to watch out for them—which, 
by the way, is something that you can't do if you're distracted! 
Remember to stay focused, pay attention, and expect the unexpected.</p>

<h3>Distractions and Young Drivers</h3>

<p>Young drivers lack experience behind the wheel and, therefore, must 
devote greater conscious attention to the driving task. This, coupled 
with teens' immaturity, overconfidence, and propensity for risky 
behaviors, means that distractions are all the more dangerous for 
adolescent motorists. Many teens do not see the connection between the 
things that distract them and their age group's high rate of vehicle 
crashes and death.</p>

<p>Before your teen takes to the road, explain the dangers of engaging 
in distracting activities while driving. Share the safe-driving tips 
provided here. Talk with your teen about how to deal with driving 
distractions. Explain the importance of driving safely and staying 
alive. Most importantly, set a good example for them by refraining 
from distracting activities while <em>you</em> are driving!</p>

<h2>The Vehicle</h2>

<p>Any vehicle operated on a public road or highway must be equipped 
to certain standards, but motorists should be primarily concerned with 
making sure their vehicles receive regular maintenance at the hands of 
a qualified mechanic. Every driver, by seeing to it that critical 
vehicle systems are operating properly, can help to ensure safer travel 
each and every time they get behind the wheel.</p>

<p>It also helps if you're comfortable with your vehicle's instruments 
and commonly used controls. Adjust seats and safety restraints, 
mirrors, and other controls <em>before</em> starting out, as attempting 
to adjust them on the road can divert your attention away from other 
important considerations—like the driving environment.</p>

Preventive maintenance. Have your vehicle serviced regularly. Routine 
care and attention will also help to keep your vehicle running well, 
and keep you safer on the road. Check for leaks on the pavement under 
the vehicle. Keep an eye on your gauges for warning signs. Be observant 
of strange vibrations, smells, and sounds as you drive. When you refuel, 
check oil and fluid levels. Clean your windshield. Replace worn wiper 
blades. Check tires for proper tread and inflation.</p>
</div> -->


<h3>Required Equipment</h3>

<h4>Lighting Systems</h4>

<p>One of the primary tenets of defensive driving is to see and be seen, 
and a vehicle's lighting systems go a long way toward making that happen. 
As a general rule, your vehicle's lights must make it visible on a 
straight, level, unlighted roadway, under clear atmospheric conditions. 
All required lights should be in good working order at all times; the 
lenses may not be cracked or broken, and they should be kept clean and 
clear.</p>

<p><strong>Headlights</strong></p>

<p>Drivers must activate their headlights when operating a vehicle 
"during darkness, or inclement weather, or both." Use your headlights 
from 30 minutes after sunset until 30 minutes before sunrise. In 
addition, headlights must be used whenever conditions prevent a driver 
from clearly discerning a person or other motor vehicle on the highway 
from a distance of 1,000 feet, or when driving in conditions that require 
windshield wipers to be in continuous use. If your vehicle isn't equipped 
with daytime running lights, you might activate your headlights whenever 
you drive to increase your visibility to others.</p>
<!-- CVC 280, CVC 24400; CVC 38335 -->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Headlight_Icon.jpg" alt="Headlight Icon">
<div class="caption">Headlights must be activated <br>
during times of darkness, <br>
when prevailing conditions <br>
limit visibility to 1,000 feet, <br>
or when windshield wipers <br>
must be in continuous use.</div>
</div>

<p>Headlights must project a white or yellow light, and should come in 
two varieties. <strong>Low beam headlights</strong> must be able to 
illuminate objects at a distance of at least 100 feet. <strong>High 
beam headlights</strong>, meanwhile, must be able to illuminate objects 
at a distance of at least 350 feet. (If you have an automobile that was 
manufactured prior to September 1940, you may be allowed to drive with 
a single beam headlight that reaches at least 200 feet.)</p>
<!--CVC 25950 deals w/color of lights (throughout this section)-->

<p>High beams may cast light into the eyes of an oncoming driver and 
can temporarily blind that person. Similarly, high beams can blind the 
driver of a vehicle that is being followed. Therefore, you are required 
to dim your high beams within 300 feet of a vehicle that you are 
following, and within 500 feet of an oncoming vehicle.</p>
<!--CVC 24406, 24407, 24409-->

<p>Keep in mind as well that the angle of high beams shine them directly 
into any precipitation that you may encounter. The light is reflected 
back at you, and what you see can look like an impenetrable white wall. 
For that reason, when driving in inclement weather, drivers should keep 
their headlights on the low beam setting.</p>

<p>Vehicles may be equipped with up to two <strong>fog lamps</strong>, 
mounted on the front of the vehicle at a height of between 12 inches 
and 30 inches, inclusive (between 12 and 40 inches, inclusive, on a 
motorcycle). <em>Fog lamps should always be used in conjunction 
with—and not as a replacement for—low beam headlights.</em> 
Vehicles may also be equipped with up to two red fog taillamps, which 
may be lighted when visibility is less than 500 feet.</p>
<!--CVC 24403, 24602-->

<p><strong>Rear Lighting Equipment</strong></p>

<p><strong>Taillights.</strong> During darkness, every motor vehicle, 
other than a motorcycle, is required to display at least two lighted 
taillamps. These taillights are to be mounted with at least one on 
each rear corner, and they must be at the same level. They must be 
red in color and must be visible from 1,000 feet. Motorcycles are 
required to have only one taillight.</p>
<!--CVC 24600-->

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Taillight.jpg" alt="Taillight">
</div>

<p><strong>Stop Lamps.</strong> Stop lamps, also known as <em>brake 
lights</em>, are key in communicating to other drivers that your 
vehicle is slowing down or stopping. Stop lamps are often 
incorporated into taillights, and they have similar placement 
requirements. Stop lamps are to emit a red light, upon application 
of the service brake, that is plainly visible from a distance of 300 
feet to the rear both during normal sunlight and at nighttime. A 
supplemental stop lamp may be mounted in the center of a vehicle's 
rear window, so long as the light is not visible to the driver.</p>
<!--CVC 24603-->

<p><strong>Back-Up Lamps.</strong> Every motor vehicle, other than a 
motorcycle, is required to have a lamp that projects a white light that 
illuminates the highway to the rear of the vehicle for a distance not 
to exceed 75 feet. Back-up lamps should light only when the reverse 
gear is engaged.</p>
<!--CVC 24606-->

<p><strong>License Plate Lamps.</strong> Either the taillight or a 
separate lamp must illuminate a vehicle's rear license plate with 
white light during times of darkness so as to ensure that the plate is 
legible from a distance of 50 feet to the rear.</p>
<!--CVC 24601-->

<p><strong>Lamp or Flag on Projections.</strong> Drivers are required 
to secure a lamp or flag to projecting loads that extend four feet or 
more beyond the rear of the vehicle. A solid red or fluorescent orange 
cloth that is at least 12 inches square must be hung from the extreme 
end of the load. Two red lights are to be used during times of darkness.</p>
<!--CVC 24604-->

<p><strong>Directional Signals</strong></p>

<p>Commonly referred to as <em>turn signals</em>, drivers employ this 
lighting system to notify other users of the roadway of their intention 
to turn or change lanes. Drivers must operate their directional signal 
for at least 100 feet before any change of direction. Electric signals 
flash a white or amber at the front of the vehicle and a red or amber 
light at the rear of the vehicle, and must be visible for at least 300 
feet in normal sunlight and at night. If your vehicle fails to do so 
automatically, be sure to turn off your indicator after the maneuver 
is complete.</p>
<!--CVC 22107 - 22108; CVC 24951 - 24953-->

<p>It is important to realize that, when your vehicle is towing another 
vehicle or a trailer, others on the roadway still need to be able to 
tell when you are going to turn; a signal system needs to be in place 
on the trailing vehicle. Similarly, when a vehicle lacks working 
electric turn signals, hand and arm signals are to be used to indicate 
changes of direction and speed.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Hand_Signals.jpg" alt="Hand Signals">
<div class="caption" align="center">In the event that your vehicle lacks electric <br>
signals or they are malfunctioning, use these <br>
hand signals (as seen from behind the signaler) <br>
to alert other drivers that you are turning, <br>
changing lanes, or slowing down.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Other Lighting Considerations</strong></p>

<p>A vehicle may never be driven with its <strong>parking lamps</strong> 
lighted, except when they are being used as turn signals or when the 
headlights are also lighted.</p>

<p><strong>Emergency flashers</strong>, or <em>hazard lights</em>, 
should really be used only…well, in an <em>emergency</em>. At 
those times, activate your emergency flashers and pull to the side of 
the road. Use the flashers in conjunction with safety cones or triangles, 
if you have them. If you see another vehicle with its emergency flasher 
activated, slow down and allow the driver of the other vehicle plenty of 
space to deal with whatever issue they may be experiencing.</p>

<h4>Instrument Panel</h4>

<p>The instrument panel on the dashboard has numerous gauges and 
indicators that will provide warnings and inform the driver of various 
operating conditions of the vehicle. Drivers should consult the owner's 
manual for their vehicle to determine the specifics of these controls, 
instruments, and warning indicators, as they vary widely depending the 
vehicle's make, model, and year of manufacture. Always take care, 
however, to make sure that the instruments are working correctly and 
that you can see them. The instrument panel's illumination is on an
adjustable dimmer that should be set bright enough to make all of the 
indicators visible during daytime driving conditions, yet not so bright 
that glare from the instrument panel disturbs you when you're driving 
at night.</p>

<p>A taxi passenger tapped the taxi driver on the shoulder to ask him a question. 
The driver screamed, lost control of the car, nearly hit a bus, went up on the 
footpath, and stopped inches from a shop window. For a second everything went 
quiet in the cab, then the driver said, "Don't ever do that again! You scared 
the daylights out of me!"</p>

<p>"I didn't realize that a little tap would scare you so much," the passenger

cab driver. I've been driving a hearse for the last 25 years."</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
</div>

<h4>Hoses, Belts, and Fluids</h4>

<p>A well-maintained vehicle is critical to your safety. This is always
true, but especially on long drives at high speeds (or when driving into 
remote locations or bad weather). Prepare for the worst by maintaining 
your vehicle before you start out.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Belts-Hoses.jpg" alt="Belts-Hoses">
</div>

<p><strong>Hoses and Belts.</strong> Hoses and belts are stressed when 
engines work overtime, but they also degrade naturally with age. These 
components should be supple and free of cuts and abrasions. Hoses should 
have good connections at both ends; belts should have less than an inch 
of play.</p>

<p><strong>Coolant.</strong> To help prevent overheating, check the 
coolant or have a mechanic do it for you. Adequate coolant levels, as 
well as the proper mixture of water and anti-freeze, can protect your 
engine whether you're traveling in extreme heat or extreme cold.</p>

<p><strong>Oil.</strong> Your engine uses oil to stay lubricated and cool. 
Change your oil as recommended in your owner's manual, and make sure that 
you're not losing oil between service appointments. Check the dipstick 
(graduated markings will tell you whether you have enough or if you need 
to add more), and top off your oil as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Air Filter.</strong> Just like you, your car needs to breathe. 
And, like you, it works better with clean air. It's the job of the air 
filter to strain out damaging contaminants from the air that your 
vehicle takes it. Check the air filter—and replace it as 
needed—to ensure that your engine is getting the oxygen it needs.</p>

<p><strong>Battery.</strong> Once the engine is running, the alternator 
will generate the electrical power you vehicle needs. Make sure your 
battery is in good condition so you can get the vehicle started, 
however. Modern batteries are usually "maintenance free"—you 
won't be able to service them, just replace them when they go bad. You 
can help your battery by ensuring that there is good, corrosion-free 
contact between the connectors and the terminals, though.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Some of the information presented here 
is pertinent only to conventional, internal combustion engines; and 
this course is not intended to provide comprehensive maintenance 
instructions. If the information provided here is not pertinent to 
your vehicle, or if you have <em>any</em> questions about proper 
vehicle maintenance, consult your owner's manual, vehicle dealer, or 
a trusted mechanic. A lot of great information is also available on 
the Internet. You might perform a search for the specific information 
you're looking for, or browse a few respectable automotive enthusiast 
sites.</p>

<div class="caption">Ummm…that's not the <br>
kind of horn we're <br>
talking about here!</div>
</div>

<h4>Horn</h4>

<p>Every motor vehicle operated on a highway must be outfitted with 
an operational horn that can be heard from a distance of at least 200 
feet. It is a violation, however, if your horn is unreasonably loud or 
harsh. Likewise, your vehicle's horn is not a means for you to express 
yourself or to alert your friends that you're near. It should be used 
only sparingly to warn other users of the roadway of imminent danger.</p>
<!--CVC 27000(a); CVC 27001(a)-->

<h4>Windshields and Mirrors</h4>

<p><strong>Windshields and Windows</strong></p>

<p>Every passenger vehicle, other than a motorcycle, must be equipped 
with a windshield adequate to protect the driver from the elements. 
Despite the need for some protection, windows need to be (relatively) 
transparent. Drivers acquire visually nearly 90% of the information 
necessary to safely operate a motor vehicle, and they need to be able 
to see what's going on outside of their vehicles. Windshields and 
other windows should be kept clean and must be replaced if they are 
broken, cracked, or discolored.</p>
<!--CVC 26700; CVC 26710-->

<p>Like peanut butter goes with jelly, windshields need to be paired 
with windshield wipers. If the vehicle has a windshield, it must have 
wipers that can be operated as necessary to clear the glass of fog 
condensation, snow, or rain, under all ordinary operating conditions. 
Wiping off the blades every few weeks with a rag dipped in 
windshield-washer fluid helps to remove oxidized rubber and other 
build-up. Wiper blades will rarely be effective after more than a year 
or two, however, and should be replaced whenever they fail to cleanly 
clear moisture from the windshield.</p>
<!--CVC 26706 - 26707-->

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Windshield.jpg" alt="Windshield"></div>

<p>Because visibility is critically important, vehicles are forbidden to 
have any object or material placed in or on the windows that blocks the 
driver's view of the road, except…</p>

<ul>
<li>rearview mirrors.</li>
<li>adjustable, nontransparent sun visors that are mounted 
forward of the side windows and are not attached to the glass.</li>
<li>signs, stickers, or other materials that are displayed in 
a 7-inch square in the lower corner of the windshield farthest 
removed from the driver; such items that are displayed in a 
7-inch square in the lower corner of the rear window farthest 
removed from the driver; or such items that are displayed in 
a 5-inch square in the lower corner of the windshield nearest 
the driver.</li>
<li>objects on side windows to the rear of the driver.</li>
<li>a rear window wiper motor, or rear trunk lid handle or 
hinges.</li>
<li>objects on the rear window(s), if the vehicle is equipped 
with outside mirrors on both sides (see "Mirrors" below).</li>
<li>temporary, easily removable sun screening devices on the 
front side windows for use by an occupant who possesses a 
document, signed by a licensed physician, which states that the 
person must be shaded from direct sunlight because of health 
considerations. These sun screens may not be used during times 
of darkness, and must be made of a material that is green, gray, 
or neutral smoke in color that allows luminous transmittance of 
at least 35%.</li><!--(see also CVC 26708.2)-->
<li>an electronic communication or toll device affixed to the 
center uppermost portion of the interior of the windshield 
within an area that is not greater than 5 inches square.</li>
<li>a portable GPS unit mounted in a 7-inch square in the lower 
corner of the windshield farthest removed from the driver, or 
in a 5-inch square in the lower corner of the windshield 
nearest the driver, and outside of an air bag deployment zone, 
if the system is used only for door-to-door navigation while 
the motor vehicle is being operated.</li>
<li>a video event recorder with the capability of monitoring 
driver performance to improve driver safety may be mounted in 
a 7-inch square in the lower corner of the windshield farthest 
removed from the driver, in a 5-inch square in the lower corner 
of the windshield nearest the driver and outside of an air bag 
deployment zone, or in a 5-inch square at the center uppermost 
portion of the interior of the windshield.</li>
</ul>
<!--CVC 26708(a) - (b)-->

<p>Transparent tinting material may be applied to the top portion of the 
windshield to reduce glare, so long as…</p>

<ul>
<li>the bottom edge of the material is at least 29 inches above 
the undepressed driver's seat when measured from a point five 
inches in front of the bottom of the backrest with the driver's 
seat in its rearmost and lowermost position with the vehicle on 
a level surface.</li>
<li>the material is not red or amber in color.</li>
<li>the material does not reflect sunlight or headlight glare 
into the eyes of other drivers.</li>
<li>the tinting material contains no opaque lettering, nor any 
lettering that distorts visual perception (including colors).</li>
</ul>
<!--CVC 26706(c)-->

<p>Clear, colorless material may be applied to the front side windows to 
block ultraviolet solar radiation, provided that…</p>

<ul>
<li>the material has a minimum visible light transmittance of 
88%.</li>
<li>the material has the abrasion resistance of AS-14 glazing.</li>
<li>the driver possesses a certificate from the installing 
company or the manufacturer certifying that the material was 
properly installed and complies with CVC requirements.</li>
<li>the material is immediately removed or replaced if it is so 
damaged as to prevent clear vision.</li>
</ul>
<!--CVC 26706(d); CVC 26708.5-->

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Rearview_Mirror.jpg" alt="Rearview Mirror">
</div>

<p><strong>Mirrors</strong></p>

<p>Once you've made sure that you can see out of the windows on your 
vehicle, you have to make sure that the mirrors are helping to get the 
best possible visual coverage around the vehicle. Every motor vehicle 
must have a mirror that reflects to the driver a clear view of the road 
for a distance of at least 200 feet to the rear of the vehicle. All 
motor vehicles registered in California, except motorcycles, must have 
at least two mirrors, including one on the left-hand side. If the 
driver's view to the rear is blocked for any reason, there must be a 
mirror on the right side of the vehicle as well.</p>
<!--CVC 26709-->

<h4>Tires</h4>

<p>Most of the time, your tires just do their thing—which is to 
keep your vehicle securely attached to the roadway so you can maintain 
control while maneuvering. Safe drivers remember to occasionally check 
their tires for wear and tear and tread depth, however.</p>

<p>Tires on standard passenger vehicles may have no less than 1/32 
inch of tread in any two adjacent major grooves. The <em>Penny Test</em> 
is a quick check of tread depth, as 1/32 inch is approximately the 
distance from the edge of a Lincoln-head penny to the top of Lincoln's 
head. Perform the test by inserting a penny head-down between two treads 
until the top edge of the penny is touching the bottom of the tire 
groove. If the tread obscures the top of Lincoln's head, your tires are 
good. On the other hand…"If you see the top of Lincoln's head, 
you should know the tire is 'dead'." A tread depth gauge provides a 
more reliable measure, but the Penny Test can be used to determine if 
a more careful inspection is needed.</p>
<!-- CVC 27465 -->

<p>Underinflated or overinflated tires compromise vehicle control and 
rob you of valuable tire life and fuel efficiency. Check and adjust 
tire pressure when the tires are cold—i.e., before you have 
driven very far/long. (Tires heat up as they drive, and they take about 
half an hour to cool down; or you could just check the tires first 
thing in the morning.) The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle 
can usually be found in the owner's manual and/or on a sticker inside 
the 	sill of the driver's door. Check tire pressure at least once a 
month—especially if you live in an area with substantial 
temperature fluctuations, as dramatic variations in ambient temperature 
can have a significant effect on tire pressure.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Tire_Inflation.jpg" alt="Tire Inflation"></div>

<p>Don't forget about your spare tire just because you don't see it 
very often! Make sure that your spare is in good condition and properly 
inflated. That way it'll be there for you when you really need it.</p>

<!--<p>As well, take care that your tires wear <em>evenly</em>. Tires that 
are unevenly worn can indicate the need for a front-end alignment or 
some other corrective maintenance. Heed these warnings, as a poorly 
maintained suspension can rob you of valuable vehicle control when you 
need to make an extreme maneuver to avoid a hazard.</p>-->

<h4>Brakes</h4>

<p>Each vehicle on the roadway must have brakes that are in "good 
working order." Vehicles are extremely diverse in shape and size, 
however, and they possess diverse stopping requirements. Nonetheless, 
brakes should apply stopping power equally to wheels on opposite sides 
of the vehicle, and should be able to bring the vehicle to a stop in a 
relatively straight line under all conditions of loading and on any 
grade on which it is operated. Stopping ability will be affected by 
environmental conditions as well, and drivers should remember to slow 
down and allow greater following distances under poor road or weather 
conditions—when brakes naturally will be less effective.</p>

<p>An <em>anti-lock braking system</em> (ABS) can extend the 
functionality of your service brakes by preventing the wheels from 
locking up under hard braking. While an ABS helps to stabilize the 
vehicle during braking in the rain or other reduced-traction situations, 
it will not provide much benefit on clean, dry pavement. In other words, 
anti-lock braking systems do not affect your ability to stop, they only 
help you to retain control of the vehicle under hard braking—which 
can be helpful in avoiding a skid or in steering around a road hazard. 
<em>Never pump anti-lock brakes</em> in an attempt to prevent your 
wheels from locking during hard braking. Instead, apply firm, steady 
pressure to the brake pedal throughout the braking maneuver; the ABS 
system will do the pumping for you. To most effectively stop a vehicle 
<em>without anti-lock brakes</em>, however, the driver may need to ease 
up slightly on the brake pedal and/or pump the brakes to prevent the 
wheels from locking up during braking.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Brake_Diagram.gif" alt="Brake Diagram">
</div>

<p>Regular maintenance of your brakes involves a periodic check of the 
fluid level in the hydraulic system. Top off the fluid reservoir (it's 
generally in the engine compartment and clearly marked to indicate 
proper levels) to keep your brakes in good working order, since 
hydraulic pressure is what makes everything else in the system work. 
At least once a year, when you get your tires rotated (and you 
<em>should</em> get your tires rotated at least once a year), have the 
brake cylinders and pads inspected for wear. Of course, it should go 
without saying that if you experience any problems braking, stop 
driving the vehicle immediately and have the system checked by a 
qualified service technician.</p>

<p><strong>The Parking Brake</strong></p>

<p>A <em>parking brake</em> works to keep a vehicle from rolling 
away while it is parked, and a parking brake is required to be able 
to hold the vehicle (and/or towed objects) in position on clean, dry 
pavement at any grade. Except for motorcycles, every vehicle is 
required to have a working parking brake that is operated separately 
from the service brake system. Unlike the service brake pedal, the 
controls for parking brakes are sometimes put in unusual locations. 
Many parking brake pedals are situated near the service brake pedal, 
but to the left and slightly above; hand-operated parking brake 
controls are typically positioned on the center console.</p>

<h4>Safety Belts</h4>

<p>The occupants of a motor vehicle are far more likely to suffer 
injuries from secondary collisions than from the primary collision 
(i.e., the motor vehicle actually striking another object). 
<em>Secondary collisions</em> occur as bodies and objects are thrown 
around following the primary collision and strike part of the vehicle's 
interior or each other. It is the mitigation of these secondary 
collisions where occupant safety restraints are of great value. While 
no safety system can completely eliminate injuries, safety belts, air 
bags, and headrests significantly reduce their severity.</p>

<p>The law states that each and every person in a vehicle—the 
driver and passengers alike—must be properly restrained, and 
seat belts need to be in good condition and in proper working order at 
all times. Folks who don't want to wear a seat belt talk a lot about 
individual freedom of choice and the inconvenience of seat belts. But 
studies show that safety restraints reduce injuries and deaths in motor 
vehicle collisions by fifty percent when the seat belt is worn properly. 
The safest cars on the road today have three-point belts for even 
back-seat passengers, with air bags strategically placed to decrease 
head trauma and other bodily injury.</p>

FOOTAGE OF DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE VARIOUS SAFETY SYSTEMS</span><br/><br/>

<span class="tran_voice">STEVE (VOICEOVER)</span><br/><br/>

Safety belts. Seat belts prevent the occupants of motor vehicles 
from flying through the windshield or toward the dashboard, or into 
the seat back in front of them in the event of a collision. Quite 
simply, safety belts are your best protection against injury in a 
collision.<br/><br/>

Safety belts and child safety seats help occupants avoid injury by 
preventing ejection from vehicle, shifting crash forces to the 
strongest parts of the body, distributing energy over a wider area, 
allowing the body to slow down gradually, protecting the head and 
spinal cord.<br/><br/>

A typical seat belt consists of a lap belt which lies across the 
pelvis, and a shoulder belt, which lies across the chest. When worn 
correctly, snug fit with proper positioning, the belts will spread 
the stopping forces in a collision over the rib cage and pelvis. 
Proper fit is crucial. The lap portion must be worn low and snug, 
across the hips, and the shoulder belt must lay snug across the 
chest, away from the neck and face. Never tuck the shoulder belt 
under the arm, or behind the back.</p>
</div> -->


<p><strong>Safety Belt Requirements</strong></p>

<p>The CVC specifies the following requirements for safety belts:</p>

<ul>
<li>A person may not operate a motor vehicle (except a 
motorcycle) on a highway unless the driver and all passengers 
16 years of age or over are properly restrained by a safety 
belt. This does not apply to:</li>
<ul>
<!-- <li>the operator of a taxicab, when the cab is driven on 
a city street and is engaged in the transportation of 
fare-paying passengers</li>
( removed at recommendation of CTSI reviewer, 9/2018 ) -->
<li>a vehicle occupant who has a physically disabling 
or medical condition which would prevent appropriate 
restraint use (as certified by a licensed doctor)</li>
<li>a person delivering newspapers to customers along 
that person's route</li>
<li>a person performing the duties of a rural mail 
carrier</li>
<li>a person engaged in the collection of solid or 
recyclable waste along that person's route</li>
</ul>
<li>Safety belts must be workable and free of cuts, fraying, 
or other damage.</li>
<li>Drivers are legally responsible to see that all children 
under 16 years of age are properly restrained with a seat belt 
or federally approved child restraint system. If they are 
present in the vehicle, parents or guardians are legally 
responsible to see that their children are properly 
restrained.</li>
</ul>
<!--CVC 27315-->

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Safety_Belts_Required.jpg" alt="Safety Belts Required">
</div>

<p>Other occupant restraint considerations include the following 
regulations:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is unlawful for anyone to ride, or for a driver to allow 
someone to ride, outside of those areas of a vehicle designed 
for normal use by passengers (e.g., it is illegal to transport 
persons in a vehicle's trunk).</li>
<!--CVC 21712-->
<li>It is against the law to ride, or to carry passengers, in 
the back of a pickup truck, unless the passenger is secured 
with a restraint system.</li>
<!--CVC 23116-->
<li>It is illegal to transport on a highway any animal in a 
cargo area unless the animal is cross tethered or enclosed so 
as to prevent it from jumping or being discharged from the 
vehicle (except for livestock or a dog transported for purposes 
of farming or ranching).</li>
<!--CVC 23117-->
</ul>

<p><strong>Use of Occupant Safety Restraints</strong></p>

<p><strong>Seat Belts.</strong> Seat belts now come as lap-and-shoulder 
belts, usually in a single, adjustable harness. Lap belts should be 
adjusted so that they fit snugly over the hips and across the lap. 
Shoulder belts should extend over the collarbone and across the chest, 
with no more play between the belt and the chest than the width of a 
fist. Never wear the shoulder belt behind your back or under your arm.</p>

<p><strong>Headrests.</strong> Headrests should be adjusted so that the 
middle of the headrest is level with the middle of the back of the head.</p>

<p><strong>Air Bags.</strong> Air bags are a <em>Supplemental Restraint 
System</em> (SRS). They are intended to be used in conjunction with 
safety belts. Air bags are designed to inflate at speeds of up to 200 
mph, and they expand to a depth of 12 to 18 inches in less than 1/20 
second. For this reason, drivers should sit a minimum of 10 inches away 
from the steering column. Similarly, it is safest to seat small adults 
and children in the rear seat.</p>

<!-- <div id="transcript3"><p class="content"><span class="tran_title">
CRASH TEST FOOTAGE SHOWING AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT</span><br/><br/>

<span class="tran_voice">STEVE (VOICEOVER)</span><br/><br/>

Air bags combined with lap-shoulder safety belts provide the highest 
level of protection possible for occupants of motor vehicles. Air 
bags are a supplemental restraint, and must be used along with 
safety belts. They are designed to deploy only in a moderate to 
severe frontal or near frontal collision. Occupants are likely to be 
protected in a less severe crash by just the safety belts.</p>
</div> -->


<p><strong>Traveling with Children</strong></p>

<p>State laws regulating child restraint use have become extremely strict, 
as automobile collisions are the leading killer of children under the 
age of five in the United States. In California, children who are under 
the age of eight <em>must</em> be properly secured in a rear seat in an 
appropriate child passenger restraint system meeting applicable federal 
motor vehicle safety standards. A child who is under eight years of age, 
but who is 4' 9" in height or taller, may be properly restrained by a 
safety belt rather than a child passenger restraint system.</p>
<!--CVC 27360(a), 27360.5-->

<p>Further, a child under the age of two must be secured in a 
<em>rear-facing</em> child safety seat. A child weighing 40 or more 
pounds or who is 40" or more in height is exempt, but remains subject 
to all other child restraint requirements. (Children are to always be 
secured in a manner that complies with the height and weight limits 
specified by the child passenger restraint system used.)</p>
<!-- CVC 27360(b) -->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Child_Seat.jpg" alt="Child Seat">
</div>

<p>Children who would normally be required to ride in the back seat 
may ride in the front if…</p>

<ul>
<li>there is no rear seat.</li>
<li>the rear seats are rear-facing seats or side-facing 
jump seats.</li>
<li>a restraint system cannot be installed properly in 
the rear seat.</li>
<li>all rear seats are already occupied by children 7 years 
of age or under.</li>
<li>medical reasons necessitate that the child not ride in 
the rear.</li>
</ul>
<!--CVC 27363-->

<p>For more information about child safety restraints, visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chp.ca.gov/programs-services/programs/child-safety-seats">California 
Highway Patrol's helpful Web page</a>, which includes links to videos. And 
if you need help installing or using a child safety seat, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website provides a 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cps/cpsfitting/index.cfm">Fitting 
Station Locator</a>.

</p><p>Many four-door vehicles now come equipped with <strong>child safety 
locks</strong> to prevent children seated in the rear of the passenger 
cabin from opening a door unexpectedly. While the child safety lock 
system is activated, the rear doors cannot be opened from the inside; 
the doors can only be opened with the outside handles. Some vehicles 
are also furnished with <strong>window locking mechanisms</strong>. 
These window locks prevent the windows in the rear doors from opening 
more than about three-quarters of the way. This safety mechanism helps 
to prevent a child from accidentally falling out of the window.</p>

<h4>The following information could save your life or that of a loved one!</h4>

<p>If you're planning to buy an automobile, it's worth investing some 
time to make sure that your vehicle of choice is likely to provide 
the measure of safety necessary to survive a collision. The NHTSA was 
largely responsible for a federal law which took effect in 2007 that 
requires all new vehicles being sold by dealers to display crash test 
information next to the sticker price. A "five-star" collision rating 
is the highest, while a "one-star" rating is the lowest.</p>

<p>The government periodically tests all major models and ranks them 
in a few categories (e.g., front-end or side impact collisions).
Spending a few minutes on the website of the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings">NHTSA.gov/ratings</a>) will 
provide you with safety rating data for almost all new and used 
vehicles. Please visit this educational site for safety ratings and 
loads of other useful driving safety information. Your life or that 
of a loved one may depend on it!</p>

<h3>Handling Mechanical Failures</h3>

<p>If your vehicle ever becomes stalled, it is crucial that you get to 
a safe position as soon as possible. Pulling to a shoulder of the road 
is best, but shoulder conditions may limit that option. Even if there 
is no shoulder, try to get your vehicle as far out of traffic lanes as 
possible (preferably to the right). Activate your emergency flashers to 
warn other motorists to steer clear of your stalled vehicle; ideally, 
your vehicle should be visible for at least 200 feet in each direction. 
Call for help with a mobile phone if you have one.</p>

<p>Unless you absolutely feel that you must walk to get help, it is 
safest to stay in the vehicle with the doors locked and your seat 
belt on. If you must exit the vehicle, exit on the side of the vehicle 
<em>away</em> from traffic. Always be cautious of strangers offering 
help, as they may have malicious intentions. If a stranger approaches, 
politely thank the person and let them know that help is on the way 
and that their assistance is not needed.</p>

If your vehicle breaks down on the roadway, get as far away from 
traffic as possible. Look at these near misses&hellip;<br /><br />

<span class="tran_title">VIDEO FOOTAGE: A montage of footage from 
emergency vehicles' dashboard cameras showing crashes and near-crashes 
involving vehicles stopped too close to the roadway.</span></p>
</div> -->


<h4>Engine</h4>

<p><strong>Accelerator Stuck</strong></p>

<p>If your gas pedal becomes stuck, the first thing you should do is to 
depress the gas pedal sharply. If that doesn't release the pedal, your 
initial reaction might be to turn off the ignition, but that's a bad 
idea. Doing so may cause your steering column to lock. Instead, try to 
downshift or put the transmission into neutral. This will make the 
engine turn at high revolutions, which may overheat it—but that's 
better than the alternative. Activate your hazard lights and apply the 
brakes; as the vehicle slows, try to maneuver off of the road to a safe 
position. Once you've found a safe spot, turn off the engine and wait 
for help to arrive. If you can make a roadside repair, be sure to test 
the pedal to verify that everything is working correctly before starting 
out again.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Overheated.jpg" alt="Overheated">
</div>

<p><strong>Overheated Engine</strong></p>

<p>If you are driving in stop-and-go traffic in hot weather, or up a 
long, steep incline with your air conditioner on, your cooling system 
may not be able to keep up. If the A/C is on, turn it off. Turn on the 
heater to draw heat away from the engine. While this might be unpleasant 
for you and your passengers, your engine will love you for it—and 
you might avert permanent damage. When traffic stops, put the 
transmission into neutral and lightly depress the accelerator to increase 
the engine's fan speed. If these steps do not adequately cool the engine, 
pull to a safe spot on the side of the road and turn off the engine. 
Carefully raise the hood, but do not touch/open the radiator until the 
engine has cooled. The heat can create great pressure, and you don't want 
to be sprayed with boiling fluids!</p>

<p><strong>Engine Failure</strong></p>

<p>Use your vehicle's forward momentum to reach safety on the side of 
the road if the engine dies while you're driving. The bad news is that 
braking and steering will require extra effort, as the power assist 
systems will be inoperative. If you can, shift into neutral and try 
to restart the engine. If the engine restarts, shift into drive and 
proceed with caution.</p>

<h4>Brakes</h4>

<p><strong>Wet Brakes</strong>

</p><p>If you drive through deep water, it is likely that your brakes will 
get wet. This may cause the vehicle to pull to one side when braking, 
or the brakes may not hold much at all. To dry the brakes, apply light 
pressure to the brake pedal for a few seconds while driving at a low 
speed. The friction and resulting heat will quickly dry the brakes.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Brake_Exclaim.jpg" alt="Brake Exclaim">
</div>

<p><strong>Brake Fade</strong></p>

<p>Braking continuously while driving downhill can leave your brakes 
without real stopping power when you need it. "Riding the brakes" 
causes them to overheat and can result in uneven braking or even loss 
of braking power. Avoid brake fade when traveling downhill by shifting 
your vehicle into a lower gear to use the engine to brake. If you must 
apply the brakes, do so for a few seconds at a time and then release 
them for a few seconds to allow them to cool.</p>

<p><strong>Brake Failure</strong></p>

<p>If you experience a sudden and severe loss of braking power, 
activate your emergency flashers and sound your horn as necessary to 
warn other drivers of your situation. If the vehicle has anti-lock 
brakes, simply press hard on the brake pedal for several seconds to 
try to build up pressure in the system; if you don't have anti-lock 
brakes, quickly pump the pedal several times. If that fails to produce 
any results, gradually downshift through the forward gears to use the 
engine's braking power to slow the vehicle. You might try to use the 
parking brake—but be careful to apply it slowly and gently to 
avoid skidding out of control.</p>

<p><strong>A Deliberate Collision.</strong> This is about the only time 
we would actually encourage you to hit something with your vehicle. As 
an absolute last resort, you might need to make contact with an outside 
object to help stop your vehicle before something truly catastrophic 
happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rub your tires against a curb.</li>
<li>Rub up against a guard rail.</li>
<li>Drive into bushes or shrubbery—<em>NOT a tree</em>. 
Increasing the distance between first impact and a complete 
stop diffuses the force of impact and keeps you safe(r).</li>
<li>Avoid a head-on collision with a solid object at all 
costs!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steering</h4>

<p><strong>Power Steering Failure</strong></p>

<p>Regular maintenance checks can help to detect a problem with the 
power steering system. You might also lose power steering if the engine 
stops running, however. You can continue to drive without power-assisted 
steering, but remember that you will need to use considerably more 
effort than usual to turn the steering wheel!</p>

<div align="center"><img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Muscle_Man.jpg" alt="Muscle Man">
<div class="caption" align="center">Automotive engineer Francis W. Davis was awarded <br>
the first patent for a power steering system in 1932, <br>
and power steering was first made available commercially <br>
in the 1951 Chrysler Imperial. If you ever lose power <br>
steering, you'll get a little taste of how physically <br>
challenging it was to drive a vehicle back in <br>
"the good ol' days!"</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Total Steering Failure</strong></p>

<p>This emergency is very dangerous, but thankfully, extremely rare. 
Activate your flashers and use your horn as necessary to warn other 
drivers. Stop the vehicle as quickly and safely as possible, trying 
whatever you can to get the vehicle to the side of the roadway. 
Because you have lost directional control, however, it is likely that 
the vehicle will be stopped in traffic lanes. In this case, it is best 
to get out of the vehicle and move to a safe place on the side of the 
roadway. Of course, if traffic is so heavy that trying to leave your 
vehicle would pose a danger, stay in the vehicle with the seat belt 
on and call for help.</p>

<h4>Tires</h4>

<p>A front tire blowout will cause the vehicle to pull in the direction 
of the damaged tire; a rear tire blowout may start a fishtail skid. 
Either way, fight the urge to slam on the brakes! Grip the steering 
wheel tightly and take your foot off of the accelerator as you steer 
to the side of the road. Slow gradually, and brake gently only when you 
have the vehicle under control.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Flat_Tire.jpg" alt="Flat Tire">
</div>

<h4>Hood</h4>

<p>It can be a scary experience to have your hood fly open as you are 
cruising down the roadway. If this happens, stay calm. Slouch down in 
your seat and look through the space between the open hood and the 
engine compartment; or, if your vision is blocked there, try looking 
out the side window. Get to a safe area as quickly as possible so you 
can stop the vehicle, then close and <em>securely</em> latch the hood.</p>

<h4>Headlights</h4>

<p>If your headlights do not work, do not drive at night. If you are 
driving at night when your headlights fail, try flicking the headlight 
activation and dimmer switches. If that doesn't solve the problem, 
turn on any lights you have. You want to make sure other motorists see 
your vehicle: use parking lights, hazard lights—whatever you have 
to—to make sure traffic around you can identify you and avoid 
your vehicle. Get to a safe position as soon as possible, and don't 
drive again until the headlights are working properly.</p>

<h4>Fire</h4>

<p>If your vehicle catches fire, immediately pull to the side of the 
road (do <em>not</em> pull into a gas station!), turn off the engine, 
and get all occupants away from the vehicle. If the fire is in the 
engine compartment, do not open the hood all the way, as this will 
feed the fire more oxygen. Call the fire department. Vehicle fires 
can spread quickly and trying to fight it yourself is very dangerous.</p>

<h2>Rules of the Road</h2>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Bike_Lane.jpg" alt="Bike Lane">
<div class="caption">&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<h3>Lane Use</h3>

<h4>Bicycle Lanes</h4>

<p>Bicycle lanes are found along the right edge of some streets and are 
normally reserved exclusively for use by bicyclists. Motor vehicles are 
allowed to cross bike lanes in order to enter or leave the roadway or 
to park where parking is permitted, however; and drivers are to enter 
a bike lane to prepare for a right turn, so long as they do not enter 
it more than 200 feet before the turn. Drivers should take care to 
check their mirrors and blind spot before entering a bike lane, and 
they should always yield the right-of-way to bicyclists there.</p>

<h4>Two-Way Left-Turn Lanes</h4>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Two-Way_Left-Turn.jpg" alt="Two-Way Left-Turn">
</div>

<p>A two-way left-turn lane may be found in the middle of a two-way 
street, and is marked on each side by two painted yellow lines, the 
inner line broken and the outer line solid. If the street you're 
driving on has a two-way left-turn lane, you must use it when 
preparing for or making a left turn or when preparing for or making 
a permitted U-turn. When turning left <em>onto</em> a street with a 
two-way left-turn lane, you may use the lane before merging into 
traffic; driving across the lane and safely into an open traffic 
lane is not prohibited, however. You may not drive for more than 
200 feet in a two-way left-turn lane, and it is never to be used by 
through traffic or as a passing lane.</p>
<!--CVC 21460.5; 2012DH p. 34-->

<h4>Ending Turns</h4>

<p>As noted earlier in this course, improper turns are a leading 
cause of collisions. Right turns are to be made as close as possible 
to the right-hand curb; a right turn should, therefore, end in the 
lane farthest to the right. If you are turning right from a one-way 
onto a one-way, however, you may end the turn in any safe and open 
lane in your direction of travel. Left turns are to be made from the 
leftmost lane in your direction of travel (or a dedicated left-turn 
lane, if one is available), and may always be completed into any 
safe and open lane. Regardless of the direction that you're turning, 
however, always take care to maintain your lane throughout the turn 
when two adjacent lanes allow simultaneous turns in the same 
direction.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Biker_Dude.jpg" alt="Biker Dude">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  <!-- (space after image) -->

<h4>Motorcycles</h4>

<p>Remember that motorcycles may travel faster than automobile traffic 
on congested roadways, and can legally travel in the unused space 
between two lines of moving or stationary vehicles ("split lanes"). 
Anticipate cyclists under these conditions and take care to avoid a 
collision.</p>

<h3>Passing Other Vehicles</h3>

<h4>Special Situations</h4>

<p><strong>Bridges or Abutments</strong></p>

<p>It is illegal—and dangerous—to pass within 100 feet of a 
bridge, tunnel, or viaduct where the driver's view is obstructed. To be 
safe, you must be able to see ahead for the entire distance of the pass 
before you cross into a lane of opposing traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Hills and Curves</strong></p>

<p>Likewise, it is illegal—and dangerous—to pass upon the 
approach to a curve or to the crest of a hill where the driver's view 
is obstructed. Remember: If you can't see what might be coming at you, 
you can't know if it's safe to proceed!</p>

<p><strong>Intersections and Railroad Crossings</strong></p>

<p>It is also illegal—and dangerous—to pass within an 
intersection or in the last 100 feet approaching an intersection or 
railroad crossing. Not only can your field of view be limited under 
these circumstances, but other vehicles that might be crossing your 
path present a serious hazard.</p>

<p><strong>Oversized Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>Always pass large trucks on their left side, where you will be more 
visible to the driver. After you pass the truck, move ahead of it. 
If you linger alongside the truck, it will be very difficult for the 
driver to take evasive action if a hazard appears in the road ahead. 
Give oversized vehicles a wide berth when you pass.</p>

<p>When meeting oncoming oversized vehicles, grip the steering wheel 
tightly and countersteer as necessary to resist gusts of wind. And 
always remember to stay out of oversized vehicles' large blind 
spots.</p>

<h4>Dangerous Situations</h4>

<p>The points discussed below present common, everyday scenarios in 
which drivers might be tempted to pass. They are extremely dangerous 
situations, however, and passing should be avoided in these cases:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do not attempt to pass a long line of cars.</strong> 
Passing a single vehicle is already hazardous. Trying to pass 
two vehicles, or even a long line of cars, is <em>extremely</em> 
dangerous. Not only do you have to worry about oncoming traffic, 
you have to worry that one of the cars in the line will attempt 
to get out of line and pass at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Do not pass a vehicle that is merely slowing to 
turn.</strong> The driver may have operated the turn signal 
incorrectly. Or, your pass may startle the driver into erratic 
behavior. Besides, you'll be able to return to full speed once 
the other driver's turn is completed.</li>
<li><strong>Do not pass when the vehicle ahead of you is at or 
near the speed limit.</strong> Since you're <em>never</em> 
allowed to exceed the speed limit, you have no need to pass 
under these circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Do not pass when your sight lines are 
obstructed</strong> anywhere between the point of initiation of 
a pass and the point of completion. If you can't see what's in 
your path, you won't be able to anticipate problems—and 
you never know what you might encounter on the roadway.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid passing if you are unable to pass before 
reaching a no-passing zone.</strong> It's only common sense 
that you shouldn't <em>start</em> a pass in a no-passing zone. 
However, for safety reasons, you should take care to complete 
a pass before you enter a no-passing zone as well. Traffic 
engineers account for drivers who might be finishing a pass 
when they lay out roads, but those areas are marked <em>no 
passing</em> for a reason. It's better to be double-safe!</li>
</ul>

<div class="caption">Knowing how to apply the <br>
right-of-way rules is key <br>
to safe, defensive driving.</div>
</div>

<h3>Right-of-Way Situations</h3>

<p><em>Right-of-way</em> can be defined as "the right of one user of 
the roadway to proceed before another." Rather than specifying who 
<em>has</em> the right-of-way, traffic rules designate who should yield 
under certain circumstances. You are to yield the right-of-way…</p>

<ul>
<li>whenever necessary to avoid a collision.</li>
<li>to bicyclists as needed to allow them their right to full 
access to the road.</li>
<li>to pedestrians—especially visually- or 
mobility-impaired pedestrians and children—at crosswalks 
(marked or implied) and before crossing sidewalks.</li>
<li>to vehicle and pedestrian traffic already in an 
intersection.</li>
<li>when turning left across the path of oncoming traffic.</li>
<li>when you approach an intersection at the same time as 
another vehicle and you are the driver on the left. Remember: 
Drivers on your <em>right</em> have the <em>right</em>-of-way.</li>
<li>to traffic that arrived before you at an intersection with 
a disabled traffic signal—i.e., treat this as a four-way 
stop.</li>
<li>at an uncontrolled T-intersection, if you are driving the 
vehicle on the terminating street.</li>
<li>when merging, to traffic already on your intended route 
of travel. This includes merging onto a freeway, when you are 
entering a public street from a private road or driveway, and 
when you are pulling away from the curb to enter traffic.</li>
<li>to vehicles already occupying the lane you wish to enter 
when changing lanes or passing.</li>
</ul>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Controlled_Intersection.jpg" alt="Controlled Intersection">
<div class="caption">A controlled intersection.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Controlled vs Uncontrolled Intersections</strong></p>

<p>An <em>uncontrolled intersection</em> lacks the helpful direction of 
traffic control devices (e.g., signs or signals). Under such circumstances, 
it is common for motorists to misguidedly assume that they always "have" 
the right-of-way. Safe interaction with other users of the roadway, however, 
actually rests upon the caution and courtesy of each individual driver. 
Approach uncontrolled intersections slowly and carefully, especially where 
visibility is limited. And do your best to interact with others in a kind 
and considerate manner.</p>

<p>Conversely, the idea behind <em>controlled intersections</em> is 
that signs or signals (or a law enforcement/traffic officer) regulate 
how and when traffic may move through them. Traffic controls encourage 
an orderly flow of traffic and limit chaos at busier crossroads. 
Individuals aren't entirely without decision-making power; drivers 
must still determine whether or not it is safe to take advantage of 
the opportunities offered by traffic controls. You should never proceed 
blindly through <em>any</em> intersection, after all.</p>

<p><strong>The Anti-Gridlock Law</strong></p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Turn-Out.jpg" alt="Turn-Out">
<div class="caption">Slower vehicles must turn out <br>
to allow others to pass.</div>
</div>

<p>In an effort to combat the gridlock that can occur in major 
population centers, the State of California has made it a citable 
violation to block an intersection. Regardless of traffic controls, 
it is illegal for a driver to enter an intersection or crosswalk 
unless there is sufficient space to proceed through to the opposite 
side without obstructing cross traffic. Likewise, it is illegal (not 
to mention <em>extremely</em> dangerous!) to block a rail crossing.</p>
<!-- CVC 22526 -->

<p><strong>Where the Road or Lane Narrows</strong></p>

<p>When the road narrows, drivers in the lane that is ending are to 
merge into the lane that continues through, yielding the right-of-way 
to vehicles that are already there.</p>

<p>In some areas—usually on roads running through remote rural 
or mountainous areas—roadways or bridges may be so narrow as to 
allow the passage of traffic in only one direction at a time. In these 
cases, drivers should slow down and proceed with great caution. When 
encountering oncoming vehicles, downhill traffic must yield the 
right-of-way to uphill traffic—if necessary, backing the vehicle 
to a place on the highway where it is possible for the vehicles to pass.</p>
<!--CVC 21661-->

<p><strong>Making Use of Turn-Outs</strong></p>

<p>Trucks and other slower-moving vehicles can accumulate a long line of 
vehicles behind them as they traverse mountain roads, where passing safely 
may be difficult. On a two-lane highway where passing is unsafe because of 
traffic in the opposite direction or other conditions, any vehicle traveling 
slower than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at that 
time, behind which five or more vehicles are formed in line, must turn off 
of the roadway at the nearest designated turn-out or wherever sufficient 
area for a safe turn-out exists, in order to permit the vehicles following 
it to proceed. Designated <em>turn-outs</em> are short bump-out lanes on 
the side of the roadway that provide a safe haven for slow vehicles and 
facilitate passing. Whether you are driving the vehicle that is turning out 
or passing that vehicle, monitor distances carefully so that merges occur 
smoothly as the vehicle turning out re-enters traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Railroad Crossings</strong></p>

<p>Nationwide in 2019, there were 7,655 collisions between trains and 
motor vehicles at railroad-highway crossings. A collision with a train 
is almost twenty times more likely to be fatal (for the occupants of the 
motor vehicle) than a crash with any other type of vehicle, and more than 
twice as many people have been killed at grade crossings as have died 
in commercial plane crashes since 2000. It is crucial that you use the 
utmost care at railroad crossings!</p>

<p>A train approaching a crossing at 30 mph can require more than 
a half-mile to stop; trains traveling faster obviously need a much 
greater distance. Given those stopping requirements, it should be clear 
that a train will be unable to stop for you even if the operator sees 
you and brakes immediately. As you approach a railroad crossing, look 
and listen for trains before proceeding. Do not rely on signals at 
controlled crossings, as they could be malfunctioning. Look and listen 
for yourself. And never race a train to a crossing—if you lose, 
you lose big!</p>

</div>

<p>Never start across the tracks unless there is room for your vehicle

tracks until the vehicle ahead of you is completely clear of the tracks. 
The law requires drivers and pedestrians approaching a railroad crossing 
to stop not less than 15 feet away from the crossing and forbids them to 
proceed until safe conditions exist.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/School_Bus_Stop.jpg" alt="School Bus Stop">
<div class="caption">Drivers must stop for a school bus <br>
that is loading and unloading children, <br>
unless the bus is on the opposite side <br>
of a divided or a multi-lane (two or <br>
more lanes in each direction) highway.</div>
</div>

<p><strong>School Buses</strong></p>

<p>Children are small, unpredictable, and quick. Worse yet, they don't 
always exercise the best judgment. They depend upon you to exercise 
greater caution for their protection—and you should assume that 
whenever a school bus is stopped, it is stopped to load or unload 
children. Either stop or proceed slowly and with extreme caution as 
necessary.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Crossing_Guard.jpg" alt="Crossing Guard">
<div class="caption">Slow down in school zones, and <br>
always obey the instructions of <br>

</div>

<p>The CVC states that, upon meeting or overtaking from either direction 
a school bus that is loading or unloading schoolchildren and has its 
flashing red lights (and stop signal arm, if so equipped) displayed, 
drivers must bring their vehicles to a complete stop before passing the 
bus. Drivers may not proceed until the flashing red light signal (and 
stop signal arm, if so equipped) cease operation. Drivers who approach 
a school bus while traveling in the opposite direction on a divided 
highway or multi-lane (two or more lanes in each direction) highway do 
not need stop for the bus; but they should still proceed with great 
care, as there are clearly children in the vicinity.</p>
<!--CVC 22454-->

<p>Stay vigilant and drive with great care around school grounds 
when children are present. School zones and crossings are marked by 
five-sided yellow warning signs, and may be posted with lower speed 
limits (beyond the regular <em>prima facie</em> limits) that are in 
effect during indicated times. Crossing guards may be stationed at 
intersections near schools and should be obeyed at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Emergency Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>Emergency vehicles and workers exist for the safety and benefit of 
the public, and you should do everything in your power to assist them. 
This almost always means simply getting out of their way. Remember, 
they might be responding to a call for help from someone you know and 
love!</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Ambulance.jpg" alt="Ambulance">
</div>

<p>When emergency vehicles approach with their siren and at least one 
red light in use, you must immediately pull to the right edge of the 
roadway and stop until the emergency vehicle has passed. If you are in 
an intersection when an emergency vehicle approaches, do not stop 
there; clear the intersection and then pull over as safely and quickly 
as possible. If you cannot pull over because of parked vehicles or 
other obstacles, simply stop where you are.</p>
<!-- CVC 21806 -->

<p>Emergency vehicles are allowed to drive through intersections against 
traffic controls and to cross into lanes of opposing traffic. Therefore, 
drivers must stop even when the emergency vehicle is on the opposite 
side of the street—even a divided highway. If an emergency vehicle 
using its siren and red light approaches from <em>any</em> direction, 
pull to the side of the road.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Firefighter.jpg" alt="Firefighter">
</div>

<p>No vehicle (except other emergency vehicles) may follow within 300 
feet of an authorized emergency vehicle responding to a call. Remember 
that emergency vehicles and personnel are there for your safety. Do 
not interfere with them.</p>
<!-- CVC 21706 -->

<p><strong>"Move Over."</strong> Drivers who approach and overtake 
working emergency or service vehicles that are stopped with their 
warning lights flashing must take care to pass safely. The law requires 
that you approach with caution, and you must vacate the lane adjacent to 
such vehicles when another lane is available in your direction of travel 
and a lane change can be made safely (unless instructed otherwise by 
an official directing traffic). Drivers who cannot safely make a lane 
change are to slow down and pass at a speed that is safe for the 
existing conditions. (These requirements do not apply if the vehicle 
that is displaying flashing warning lights is not adjacent to the 
highway or is separated from the highway by a protective physical 
barrier.) Vehicles requiring these considerations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a stationary authorized emergency vehicle that is displaying 
emergency lights</li>
<li>a stationary tow truck that is displaying flashing amber 
warning lights</li>
<li>a stationary marked Department of Transportation vehicle 
that is displaying flashing amber warning lights</li>
<li>a stopped waste service vehicle<!-- , including a vehicle 
collecting recyclables or yard waste that is used for curbside 
collection, and sewer and catch basin maintenance vehicles, --> 
displaying flashing amber lights, including such vehicles 
stopped on any public street</li>
</ul>
<!-- CVC 21809, 21761 -->

<p><strong>Traffic Breaks.</strong> Law enforcement may use traffic 
breaks to slow or stop traffic so they can remove hazards from the 
roadway, to conduct emergency operations, or to prevent collisions in 
heavy fog or unusually heavy traffic. During a traffic break, the 
officer turns on the patrol vehicle's rear emergency lights, slows the 
vehicle, and weaves back and forth across the lanes of traffic. To 
assist the officer conducting a traffic break:</p>

<ul>
<li>Activate your emergency flashers to warn other drivers of 
the hazard ahead.</li>
<li>Slowly begin to decrease your speed; do not slow abruptly 
unless it is necessary to avoid a collision. Slow to the same 
speed as the officer while keeping a safe distance from the 
patrol vehicle.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to drive past the patrol vehicle, and do 
not accelerate until the patrol vehicle has turned off its 
emergency lights and traffic conditions ahead allow the return 
to normal speeds.</li>
</ul>

<div align="center">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Police_Car.jpg" alt="Police Car">
<div class="caption">Sometimes the flashing lights are for <em>you</em>!</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Law Enforcement Stops.</strong> Law enforcement officers 
occasionally pull over drivers because of a suspected traffic, equipment, 
or other legal violation. You <em>must</em> stop when given a visual or 
audible signal to do so. It is illegal to attempt to evade or elude a 
pursuing peace officer.</p>
<!-- CVC 2800.1 -->

<p>Traffic stops can be incredibly stressful for everyone involved. 
While getting pulled over is likely to put <em>you</em> on edge, it's 
just as bad for the officer(s). Statistically, one of the two most 
dangerous things a police officer does is a traffic stop, because 
officers never know who they are walking up to. If you keep your cool 
and behave predictably and responsibly, everything will go much more 
smoothly. You <em>might</em> even be let go with just a warning!</p>

<p>When a law enforcement vehicle pulls behind you and activates one 
or more red lights or sounds a siren, remember these tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Begin slowing down and signaling your intention to pull 
over and stop. Pull to the <em>right</em> side of the road 
and park in a safe place, as far from traffic as possible. 
You might even pull into a parking lot or some other area 
completely off of the roadway.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you are being pulled over on a freeway, pull 
completely onto the shoulder before stopping. If the 
officer uses a loudspeaker to direct you to the next 
exit and off of the freeway, do as instructed.</li>
<li>If you feel that it is unsafe to stop because your 
present location is dark, isolated, or if there is not 
enough room, signal, slow down, and use a hand wave to 
indicate to the law enforcement officer your intention 
to proceed to a freeway exit, well-lit area, or other 
safer place to stop.</li>
</ul>
<li>Turn on your emergency flashers. If you are pulled over 
at night, turn on your vehicle's interior lights.</li>
<li>Turn off your engine, radio, and any other device that 
could hinder your communication with the officer. Lower your 
window so you can communicate easily with the officer. Note that 
an officer may approach your vehicle on either the driver- or 
passenger side for safety reasons.</li>
<li>Remain calm and <em>stay in the vehicle</em> unless following 
an officer's instructions to exit. When in the vehicle, keep your 
seat belt fastened and ask your passengers to keep theirs 
fastened.</li>
<li>Keep your hands in plain view (preferably on the 
steering wheel), and ask your passengers to do the same. 
Do not make any movement that will make the officer think 
you are hiding or reaching for something.</li>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Police_Officers.jpg" alt="Police Officers">
</div>

<li>If the officer is driving an unmarked car or is not in 
uniform, you may ask to see identification.</li>
<li>Answer the officer's questions fully and clearly.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you don't understand something, calmly and politely 
ask for clarification.</li>
<li>If you disagree with the officer, do not argue; you will 
have your chance to make your case in court.</li>
<li>If an officer asks your permission to do something (e.g., 
search part or all of your vehicle), you have a right to say 
no. However, if you say no and the officer says they are 
going to do it anyway, you do <em>not</em> have a right to 
resist, obstruct, or interfere with their actions.</li>
</ul>
<li>The officer will likely ask to see your driver license, 
registration, and proof of insurance. If asked for these 
documents, explain to the officer where they are and then 
reach for them slowly, keeping one hand on the steering 
wheel.</li>
<ul>
<li>Drivers must produce these documents upon request; if 
they do not, officers may conduct a limited search for 
them.</li>
<li>An officer may also request the names or identification 
of passengers. Passengers may decline that request by clearly 
saying so, but may be required to identify themselves under 
some circumstances.
</li><li>In California, only federal law enforcement officers can 
ask about immigration status. If state/local officers ask a 
driver or passengers about their immigration status, they 
may decline to answer.</li>
</ul>
<li>If you are issued a citation, you will be asked to sign 
it. Do so; this is not an admission of guilt. Refusal to 
sign the citation may result in your arrest, or you may be 
required to go to the police station.</li>
<li>When the officer indicates that you are free to proceed, 
continue carefully and safely on your way.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, drivers and passengers have the right to record 
interactions with police in public spaces. If you are recording, you 
should immediately make that clear, and should not reach into concealed 
areas to retrieve a recording device without the officer's permission. 
If your recording is not interfering with the officer's ability to 
lawfully do their job, an officer cannot confiscate your recording 
device, delete the recording, or destroy the device just because you 
are using it to record. In general, you also have the right to deny 
a request to provide access to a mobile device (though under some 
circumstances—such as if you are on parole—you may have to 
give permission). Finally, no government employee can retaliate against 
you just because you recorded something in public.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Even if you believe your rights were 
violated, you should never engage in physical resistance or violence 
against an officer! If an officer does something that you believe 
violates your rights, you can voice your objection but should not 
physically resist. Everyone has the right to be safe during a traffic 
stop; your safety and the officer's safety could be jeopardized if the 
situation escalates with physical resistance or violence.</p>

<p>All members of the public have a right to file a complaint against 
any law enforcement officer or agency, and it is against the law for 
any government employee to retaliate against you for doing so; you can 
file a complaint with <a target="_blank" href="https://post.ca.gov/le-agencies">any agency</a> that employs the 
officer. You have a right to be free from discrimination based on your 
actual or perceived race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, 
religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, mental 
or physical disability, medical condition, or citizenship status. You 
also have other rights guaranteed by the United States and California 
Constitutions, as well as state and federal laws. When you file a 
complaint, the agency that employs the officer must investigate the 
complaint.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Conditions</h3>

<p>Motorists who wish to truly drive defensively must come to terms 
with the idea that they will have to prepare themselves for a trip by 
automobile and then be prepared to modify their plans as necessary in 
order to adjust to the driving environment.</p>

<h4>Nighttime/Low Visibility</h4>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Watch_Edge.jpg" alt="Watch Edge">
<div class="caption">When blinded by the headlights <br>
of an oncoming vehicle, it helps <br>
to focus on the edge line on your <br>
side of the road until the vehicle <br>
has passed.</div>
</div>

<p>Remember to activate your headlights during times of darkness, 
whenever visibility is reduced to less than 1,000 feet, or when driving 
in conditions that require windshield wipers to be in continuous use. 
Unfortunately, during hours of darkness, a driver's field of vision is 
narrowed to the confines of those vehicle's headlights. When objects 
outside of that range are visible at all, they will be less resolved 
and their distances will not be as obvious.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that drivers—both you and those who share the 
roadway with you—are more likely to be fatigued at night, and 
that you're more likely to encounter an intoxicated driver at night. 
Weaving and/or crossing lane lines can be a sign of fatigue or 
impairment. Give the other vehicle a wide berth if you witness these 
behaviors, and be prepared to stop and call 911.</p>

<p>The best solution to these problems is to drive rested and control 
your speed. Also, keep in mind these tips for night driving:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the high beam setting on your headlights whenever it 
is safe and legal to do so. Use low beams in urban areas, and 
remember to dim your high beams when you come within 500 feet 
of an approaching vehicle and within 300 feet of a vehicle you 
are following.</li>
<!-- CVC 24409 -->
<li>When blinded by the headlights of an oncoming vehicle, 
focus on the edge line on your side of the road until the 
vehicle has passed. It can take as long as two seconds to 
recover from glare at night. At 55 mph, that's half the length 
of a football field!</li>
<li>Light from inside your vehicle and from street lights 
can make it difficult for you to see the road. Keep interior 
lighting off and dim the dashboard lights. Adjust your sun 
visor as necessary to reduce glare from overhead lights.</li>
<li>Never "overdrive" your headlights. Your headlights 
illuminate your path for a certain distance ahead, and you 
should take care to drive at a speed that will allow you to 
stop within that distance. After all, you can't avoid a hazard 
that you can't see!</li>
<li>Headlights and taillights can have a hypnotic effect as 
ambient light decreases. This is especially true for drivers 
who are intoxicated. Watch for others following you too 
closely, and try to open up following distance if you are 
being tailgated—or simply allow the following vehicle 
to pass.</li>

<h4>Work Safety Zones (Construction Zones)</h4>

<p>As places of work, construction zones contain people whose minds 
are on things other than the inherent danger of their position in the 
middle of traffic. While barricades often surround construction zones, 
these barriers provide only false security—on both sides. Workers, 
equipment, and construction materials spill over their boundaries at 
unpredictable times and places. And a motor vehicle moving at even

different sub-environments—each with its own challenges.</div>

<h4>City Driving</h4>

</div>

<p>Whether you live in a suburb and commute to work in the city, or 
live in a mixed-use development in the downtown, at some time during 
the day you're likely to find yourself driving in city traffic. You 
might be cruising along sleepy residential streets lined with vehicles, 
through intersections that are uncontrolled or controlled only by signs. 
At other times, you might drive along bustling multi-laned commercial 
thoroughfares, through intersections controlled by a dizzying array of 
traffic signs, signals, and pavement markings. It all constitutes urban 
driving. Whatever the case, the keys to driving in the city revolve 
around speed control, vehicle spacing, and anticipation. Keep alert to 
make shrewd decisions, as there truly are no lulls in the city!</p>

<p>Remember these tips when driving in the city:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce speed.</strong> Excessive speed makes every 
driving situation less safe than it could be. Speed control 
is especially important in dense urban traffic, where you 
will encounter all manner of hazards. Reducing your speed as 
necessary will allow you more time to identify hazards in the 
driving environment and to react to danger. By the same token, 
remember that is also dangerous to drive so slowly that you 
impede traffic. It is preferable that you keep up with the 
flow of traffic, so long as you don't exceed the speed limit 
(including the Basic Speed Law).</li>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Congestion-Wolf.jpg" alt="Congestion-Wolf">
<div class="caption">Do your best to use the least-congested <br>
lanes of traffic, and avoid the bunches <br>
of vehicles known as "wolf packs."</div>
</div>

<li><strong>Look ahead in traffic and build a good space 
cushion.</strong> Get a sense of what's happening all around 
you so you can make good decisions as to how to respond to 
hazards. Focusing your attention well ahead of your current 
location (to where you will be in 10 – 15 
seconds—approximately one city block) allows you to 
anticipate undesirable situations. Watch for traffic signal 
cycles, lanes reserved for turning or special uses/vehicles, 
and lane closures due to road construction or traffic flow 
reversals. Creating plenty of space between your vehicle and 
the vehicles around you improves your sight 
lines—especially in congested city traffic. With a 
(minimum) three-second following distance, you can scan the 
entire driving environment and have the time and space needed 
to avoid hazards.</li>
<li><strong>Cover the brake.</strong> Anticipating dangers in 
this way will allow you to stop more smoothly and quickly than 
if you had to slam on your brakes. With the traffic congestion 
that can often be found in urban areas, such preparation just 
might save you from a collision.</li>
<li><strong>Consider your route and time of travel.</strong> 
Defensive driving is all about being safe, and safety starts 
with travel plans. Choosing when you'll drive and selecting the 
route you'll take can help to make the entire driving experience 
safer and more enjoyable.</li>

<h4>Freeway Driving</h4>

<p>Freeways are limited access highways that are intended to 
permit high-speed travel over long stretches of roadway. They are 
multi-laned roadways with gently banking curves, and feature a 
relatively uninterrupted flow of traffic. When traffic is spaced 
properly, speed is generally constant, drivers aren't distracted, 
and visibility is good. At least, that's the idea. These days, as 
the freeway system ages and bears increasing volumes of traffic, 
these "superhighways" can sometimes look more like super-parking 
lots! Freeways can only be as efficient as drivers' ability to use 
them properly. It is, therefore, a good idea to prepare a plan 
of action (map out your route) before getting on the freeway.</p>

<p><strong>Entering the Freeway</strong></p>

<p>There are two broad types of freeway entrance ramps: those that end 
in an acceleration lane, and those that do not. Older freeways usually 
have relatively short ramps that dump entering vehicles directly into 
the flow of traffic. Newer freeways often have ramps that end in an 
<em>acceleration lane</em>, which provides extra pavement intended to 
help vehicles entering the roadway to more easily match speeds with 
freeway traffic.</p>

<p>In either case, your goal is to achieve freeway speeds and merge 
with through traffic as smoothly and safely as possible. Accelerate 
and glance over your shoulder to look for gaps in the freeway traffic. 
Try to identify gaps as you proceed down the ramp, since your vantage 
point is often better from there. Time your entrance so that you can 
merge from the ramp onto the freeway into an ample gap in traffic. 
It is wise to identify more than one gap in case the first closes 
before you can reach it.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Accel_Lane.jpg" alt="Accel Lane">
</div>

<p>Keep your eyes moving throughout the merge. Don't forget to look 
ahead as well as over your shoulder. Traffic entering the freeway 
may cause an unexpected slowdown, and you could find yourself 
accelerating into a merge gap only to have traffic ahead of you come 
to a standstill. Cycle your attention between the front of your 
vehicle, your mirrors and blind spot, and the gap you have chosen.</p>

<p>If for one reason or another you cannot merge, it is permissible 
to slow down and wait for another gap to appear. You are advised not 
to slow down too much, however, as you will eventually need to get 
back up to freeway speeds in order to merge. There may also be other 
merging vehicles following you down the ramp.</p>

<p>Special situations to watch for include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Timed Entry Signals:</strong> In urban areas 
with heavy traffic, entrances onto the freeway may feature a 
two-phase (red and green) timed entry signal positioned near 
the bottom of the entrance ramp to regulate vehicles' access 
to the freeway. As you approach a red signal, stop at the 
signal post or stop line and wait for the light to turn green 
before proceeding. These signals are almost always timed for 
only one vehicle to proceed at a time. Avoid the temptation to 
follow the vehicle in front of you through the signal unless 
signage specifically allows such an action.</li>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Weaving_Lanes.jpg" alt="Weaving Lanes">
<div class="caption"><em>Weaving lanes</em> form an X-shaped ramp where <br>
entering and exiting traffic must cross paths. <br>
Watch other traffic carefully to avoid a collision.</div>
</div>

<li><strong>Weaving Lanes:</strong> A rare type of freeway 
entrance is known as a <em>weaving lane</em>. Weaving lanes 
are shared entrance/exit ramps that require vehicles to cross 
paths, or "weave," as they enter and exit the freeway in the 
same general area. An antiquated design from the early days 
of freeway construction, weaving lanes are inherently more 
confusing and less safe than more modern entrance ramps. Be 
very careful when you must use them.</li>
<li><strong>Double Merge Lanes:</strong> At particularly busy 
locations, it is not uncommon to find two-lane entrance ramps 
to the freeway. Two lanes make it easier for more traffic to 
get onto the ramp, clearing congestion on the surrounding city 
streets. The two lanes will ultimately come together into a 
single lane before merging onto the freeway, so be prepared 
for this situation. Also, one of the lanes of a double-lane 
ramp may be designated for carpool use only.</li>
<li><strong>"Diamond" Lanes:</strong> Just as there are 
high-occupancy vehicle lanes on the freeway itself, there are 
designated "carpool" lanes on some entrance ramps. Pay 
attention to lane markings and signs as you proceed down an 
entrance ramp, keeping out of diamond lanes unless you are 
eligible to use them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cruising the Freeway</strong></p>

<p>On <strong>two-lane freeways</strong>, traffic should travel through 
in the right lane. Drivers need to remember that vehicles will be using 
that lane to enter and exit the freeway as well. The left lane is 
reserved for passing and for making space for drivers who are trying 
to merge with the flow of traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Freeways with three or more lanes</strong> offer more 
options, and motorists need to find a spot in traffic that is 
comfortable and appropriate for their situation:</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Freeway_Lanes.jpg" alt="Freeway Lanes">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Left Lane/"Fast Lane":</strong> Lanes toward the 
center of the freeway (toward the left in your direction of 
travel) are referred to as the "fast lanes." Despite that, 
drivers may not drive as fast they want; they must still obey 
the speed limits. Rather, these are called the "fast lanes" 
because faster traffic should move to the left. If you need 
to pass another vehicle on the freeway, try to do so on that 
vehicle's left side.</li>
<li><strong>High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes:</strong> These 
lanes (also known as <em>"diamond"</em> or <em>carpool</em> 
lanes) are reserved for use by vehicles carrying multiple 
occupants. Motorcycles and certain fuel-efficient, low-emission, 
or alternative-fuel vehicles bearing special decals may use 
these lanes without meeting minimum occupancy requirements 
(check with the <a target="_blank" href="http://arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm">California 
Air Resources Board</a> for details). The pavement of an HOV 
lane is marked with a diamond-shaped symbol and may be labeled 
with the words "Carpool Lane," and signs may be posted to 
indicate the minimum number of occupants and other particulars 
related to lane access. Drivers may not enter or exit HOV 
lanes over double solid yellow lines; entrance or exit may be 
made only in areas designated for such a maneuver or where a 
single broken line is in place to the right of the HOV lane. 
Never enter an HOV lane to pass unless you would normally have 
access to it at that point.</li>
<li><strong>Center Lanes:</strong> The center lane(s) of the 
freeway, in your direction of travel, are intended for through 
traffic. Traffic in these lanes usually travels at or near the 
speed limit, and flow is relatively unimpeded.</li>
<li><strong>Right Lane/"Slow Lane":</strong> The outside lanes 
of a freeway (toward the right in your direction of travel) are 
used by slower traffic and by vehicles entering or exiting the 
freeway.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common cause of freeway collisions is following another 
vehicle too closely. Remember to maintain a <em>minimum</em> 
three-second following distance and a suitable space cushion all 
around your vehicle!</p>

<p>The relative ease of freeway travel can lull you into complacency. 
But the high speeds of freeway travel make courtesy and the safety it 
promotes as essential as ever. If you're on the freeway and see a 
vehicle coming down an entrance ramp in such a way that your paths are 
likely to conflict, adjust your speed or change lanes to the left to 
help create a comfortable merge gap for the entering driver. Likewise, 
if you see a driver in an interior lane desperately trying to get to 
the right to exit, do what you can to make space for him or her.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Exiting the Freeway</strong></p>

<p>Exiting the freeway can be almost as precarious as attempting to 
enter it. In either situation, proper space, speed, and communication 
remain indispensable to safe driving. You can help to avert problems 
by knowing the number of your exit. Invariably, exits have at least 
one advance sign (green guide signs), and you should try to be in the 
proper lane <em>well</em> before you get to the ramp.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Decel_Lane.jpg" alt="Decel Lane">
</div>

<p>Similar to entering the freeway, you may be confronted by a ramp 
or a <em>deceleration lane</em> as you exit. Deceleration lanes allow 
drivers some room to slow down before they reach the actual ramp. 
Particularly where there is no deceleration lane, make sure to observe 
posted ramp speeds. Ramps can be short and curved, and there could be 
a stop sign or busy traffic at the end. Take the ramp slowly and be 
prepared to stop if necessary.</p>

<p>Exits are normally found on the right side of the freeway, but exits 
on the left side of the roadway—while rare—do exist. Watch 
for signs as you approach your exit so you can position yourself in the 
correct lane.</p>

<p><strong>If you miss your exit…<em>don't panic!</em></strong> 
Don't make any drastic, hasty decisions. <em>Never</em> stop, back up, 
or attempt to turn around on the freeway. Exit at the next off-ramp 
and re-enter the freeway in the opposite direction; or, if the exits 
are close together, simply proceed directly to your desired 
destination.</p>

<p><strong>Special Freeway Problems</strong></p>

<p><strong>Weather.</strong> Many drivers believe that freeways' wide 
lanes and long straightaways mitigate the effects of bad weather. 
Wrong! High speeds only serve to exacerbate any problems you might 
experience. If you encounter poor weather while traveling, slow down 
to a speed that is appropriate for the conditions.</p>

<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Hypnotized.jpg" alt="Hypnotized">
<div class="caption">Don't let fatigue or highway <br>
hypnosis get the better of you!</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Highway Hypnosis.</strong> Because drivers are rarely called 
upon to use complex driving skills during the extended stretches of 
high-speed travel experienced on rural freeways, they are prone to 
falling into a trance-like state known as <em>highway hypnosis</em>. 
This is a condition that exists between wakefulness and sleep, and it 
can lead to missed details (even exits!), hallucinations, and dozing. 
Highway hypnosis can actually be more dangerous than mere 
sleepiness/fatigue, as drivers generally have a sense of fatigue and 
can react appropriately to reduce its effects. Highway hypnosis, on 
the other hand, tends to creep up unexpectedly when monotony and 
boredom make your mind wander. To combat highway hypnosis, focus your 
attention on the driving task. Keep your eyes moving. Rest before 
setting out and make frequent stops for exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Velocitation.</strong> Another phenomenon that develops 
from monotony is <em>velocitation</em>, the tendency to gradually 
accelerate without noticing. Motorists are particularly prone to this 
in conditions of low visibility, such as fog, because they lack visual 
cues to help them determine speed. Velocitation is dangerous at any 
time, but especially as you exit the freeway. You can find yourself 
exiting onto a short, curving ramp at an unexpectedly high speed. Use 
cruise control if your vehicle is equipped with it, or check your 
speedometer regularly during freeway travel so you can keep tabs 
on your speed. When exiting, train yourself to always slow to a 
reasonable speed.</p>

<!--<p><strong>Toll Booths</strong></p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Toll_Booth.jpg" alt="Toll Booth" />
</div>

<p>It is becoming increasingly common&mdash;especially as government 
budgets shrink&mdash;for jurisdictions to finance bridge and highway 
construction and maintenance projects by collecting a toll from users. 
These small sums of money are collected from <em>toll booths</em> 
placed along the roadway. In some cases, tolls are collected every 
couple of miles. In other cases, only one toll will be collected at 
the beginning of the highway. Still others use an entrance and exit 
ticket to track the distance traveled and charge accordingly.</p>

<p>Toll booths are often part of a <em>toll plaza</em>, a series of 
booths stretched across the roadway. Warning signs, speed bumps, and/or 
rough pavement may be used to alert drivers to slow down for a toll 
plaza. The roadway will split into several lanes, each serviced by its 
own toll booth, as drivers approach the plaza. Signs will indicate 
which booths are open for service and which lane(s) are most 
appropriate for a particular driver's use. Some lanes are for motorists 
with special passes, while others are for drivers with exact change. 
Some toll booths have attendants who collect the fees. At others, 
drivers toss money into a receptacle and a gate opens to allow further 
access to the highway. Still other toll roads use transponders that 
allow money to be deducted from an account each time you venture onto 
the specialized highways that use them. To be safe, come prepared and 
carry extra change if you intend to use a toll road.</p>

<p>As you pull away from a toll booth, accelerate smoothly and continue 
on your way. Watch for other vehicles merging into your lane as the 
roadway narrows.</p>-->

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Wilderness_Road.jpg" alt="Wilderness Road">
</div>

<h4>Rural/Wilderness Driving</h4>

<p>Rural highways combine the need for well-honed driving skills with 
the need to pay close attention to the driving environment. Vehicles 
travel on them at or near freeway speeds. Yet, opposing lanes of travel 
are most often divided by nothing more than a painted yellow line on 
the road surface. Combine the close proximity of oncoming traffic with 
narrow, winding roads and diverse topography, and it's easy to see why 
rural/wilderness driving can be demanding.</p>

<p>Some rural highways are the commercial arteries of small communities, 
and everyday life, with all of its vibrancy and unpredictability, 
takes place along them. Speeds and traffic patterns are fluid and 
inconsistent. Long stretches of almost deserted straightaways can lead 
directly into a crowded small-town business district, where residents 
are conducting their daily errands. Side roads, turnoffs, driveways, 
and small businesses can be hidden right up until the last moment.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Small_Town.jpg" alt="Small Town">
</div>

<p>Highways can take you across open prairies and through majestic 
wilderness areas. Livestock and wild animals can unexpectedly obstruct 
the road. Wilderness highways may travel rugged terrain and are often 
poorly maintained. You may encounter sharp curves, steep grades, and 
sudden onsets of bad weather. Regardless of the posted speed limit, 
you must anticipate large speed variations due to population density, 
geography, and weather conditions. Defensive drivers stay alert and 
prepared for anything.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Hazards</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rough Roads and Unmarked Shoulders.</strong> Extra care 
and slower speeds should be used when driving on unimproved roads. 
Traction can be compromised by loose gravel, slippery conditions 
following rain or snow, ruts in the driving lanes, and washboard 
conditions. When steering clear of oncoming vehicles or other 
obstacles, beware of soft or nonexistent shoulders.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Bad_Road.jpg" alt="Bad Road">
</div>

<p>Even improved roads in the mountains can degrade quickly thanks to 
the frequent freeze-thaw cycles of high-altitude weather. Heavy rains, 
water run-off, and mudslides can break off huge chunks of roadway; 
rockfall and other debris are constant hazards. And, thanks to their 
remote locations and lighter traffic patterns, mountain and wilderness 
roads are often the last to see maintenance. You're often more likely 
to encounter a broken, pockmarked mess of tarmac than the pristine 
black asphalt of automobile commercial fantasy.</p>

<p><strong>Unmarked Farm and Field Driveways.</strong> The driveways 
and access roads that serve farmyards and fields are often unimproved 
and screened from the highway by windbreaks. They can be almost 
impossible to spot until the last second, and may be hiding heavy farm 
machinery and other vehicles attempting to enter the main road. Slow 
down and keep your eyes open as you near these access points; cover 
your brake as you approach.</p>

<p><strong>Animals.</strong> Signs indicating animal crossings are a 
regular feature of rural and wilderness roads. Signs may designate 
places where domesticated livestock cross near farms, as well as wild 
animal crossings. The prevalence of these signs suggests that critters 
are out there…everywhere. Animals are impulsive and move faster 
than you might think, so be ready to handle anything that might come 
at you.</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Yeti_Xing.jpg" alt="Yeti Xing">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  <!-- (space after image) -->

<p>If you do spot an animal, proceed slowly and give it a wide 
berth. If the animal is blocking the roadway, simply stop well back 
and let it do its thing; it will move eventually. It's dangerous and 
counterproductive to harass animals, as they may be spooked by your 
vehicle into unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>Animals with herd instincts, such as deer, often cross in groups. 
If one animal crosses the road, anticipate others close behind. 
Remember, as well, that wildlife can become confused and hypnotized 
by headlights when you drive at night. For your own safety and for 
the well-being of your vehicle, decrease your speed and cover the 
brake if you have reason to believe that animals are in the area.</p>

<p>Should you strike an animal with your vehicle, <em>never</em> get 
out to check on it. Injured animals are unpredictable and can be 
dangerous. Do, however, contact local authorities (animal control 
and/or the sheriff's office) so they can remove the remains from the 
roadway. If you strike livestock or some other domesticated animal, 
try to notify the owner.</p>

<!--<p><strong>Roadside Stands and Gas Stations.</strong> Small commercial 
concerns, such as gas stations or produce stands, may dot the sides 
of rural roadways. It is helpful to be prepared for drivers who may 
unexpectedly try to enter or leave such roadside establishments. 
Maintain a safe following distance from vehicles you are following, 
and cover your brake as necessary.</p>-->

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Farmer-Tractor.jpg" alt="Farmer-Tractor">
</div>

<p><strong>Slow-Moving Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>Some vehicles, such as farm machinery and vehicles drawn by animals, 
are inherently sluggish. Others, like commercial or recreational 
vehicles, can be slowed by steep hills and sharp curves. These vehicles 
are to keep to the right side of the road in their direction of travel, 
except when passing another vehicle or when preparing to turn left. 
Slower traffic should use turn-outs as necessary, when available.</p>

<p>Vehicles, or the rearmost in a combination of vehicles, operated 
at a speed of 25 mph or less are required to display a <em>slow-moving 
vehicle emblem</em>. The emblem is an equilateral triangle, having a 
minimum height of 14 inches, with a fluorescent orange center and a 
red reflective border that is at least 1 3/4 inches wide. It is to be 
mounted on the rear of the vehicle, base down, at a height of not less 
than 3 nor more than 5 feet from the ground.</p>
<!--CVC 24615-->

<p>Do not allow yourself to be frustrated into erratic maneuvers by 
slow-moving vehicles. Train yourself to accept slowdowns and patiently 
wait for a safe opportunity to pass. Take care not to close with a 
slow-moving vehicle so quickly that you run into it; always maintain 
a safe following distance. When passing, give the slow-mover plenty 
of space and make sure you don't cut it off as you return to your 
original lane.</p>

<div class="img_r">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Curvy_Road.jpg" alt="Curvy Road">
</div>

<p><strong>Handling Topography</strong></p>

<p><strong>Curves.</strong> The best way to handle a curve is to slow 
down as you enter it so you have time to respond to any unseen problems 
coming around the bend, as visibility can be restricted around bends 
in the road. It doesn't hurt to keep toward the outside of your lane 
of travel to compensate for vehicles that have strayed from their lane. 
Watch also for debris in the roadway that may not be visible until the 
last second. Accelerate out of a curve from its apex (but remember to 
stay within the speed limit).</p>

<p>Always obey lower speed limits posted near hills and curves. 
Occasionally, a speed limit sign with black text on a <em>yellow</em> 
background will tell you the <em>advised maximum speed</em> (in 
contrast to the more common black-on-white speed limit signs, which 
give the compulsory maximum). You are not strictly required to keep 
your speed below the advised limits, but there's a reason drivers have 
been advised to travel at that lower speed. As always, you may be 
cited for speeding at any time on the basis of the Basic Speed Law. 
Keep it safe for the conditions!</p>

<div class="img_l">
<img src="ca/images/chapters_tsc/Hilly_Traffic.jpg" alt="Hilly Traffic">
</div>

<p><strong>Hills.</strong> Remember that you may not pass near the 
crest of a hill if you cannot see the roadway on the other side to 
determine that it's clear. Also, take care to monitor your speed on 
hills. Gravity can decrease or increase your speed, and it can be 
difficult to regain control once things get out of hand.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Braking:</strong> Before starting down an incline, 
determine a speed that you consider safe for the grade, 
geographical features, road conditions, and weather. You might 
start with the speed on the advisory speed limit sign (if one 
is present), though this could be revised downward in 
consideration of the Basic Speed Law. As you travel downhill, 
allow gravity to accelerate your vehicle to your predetermined 
speed. Then use your brakes to reduce your speed to 5 mph below 
your predetermined speed. Release the brakes and allow gravity 
to again increase vehicle speed to your predetermined limit. 
Repeat this apply-and-release braking pattern until you reach 
the bottom of the incline. This will save your brakes from 
overheating and possible failure.</li>
<li><strong>Choosing a Gear for Descent:</strong> If you have 
a <em>manual transmission</em>, you are advised to select a 
gear before you begin your descent from the peak of a hill. If 
you wait to downshift until you are already moving downhill, 
you may find yourself stuck between gears and unable to shift 
into a lower one. Use the same gear for your descent that you 
used to get up the hill (e.g., if you had to shift into 
second gear to reach the top of the incline, use second gear 
to get down). Even if your vehicle has an <em>automatic 
transmission</em>, you can still manually select a lower gear 
to employ the engine's braking power while traveling down long, 
steep grades.</li>
</ul>

The biggest dangers presented by this type of roadway involve encounters with vehicles that are changing speed and direction, and vehicles that are traveling too close to one another. Despite the relative ease of travel, weather can also be a consideration.</td></tr><tr><td>_____ is/are NOT a common consideration in rural/wilderness driving.</td><td>HOV lanes</td><td>Rural/wilderness roads require drivers to attend to features of the terrain that can limit visibility and maneuverability (for example, hills and curves, unimproved or poorly maintained roads, and groves/windbreaks around driveways or field access roads). Drivers are also more likely to encounter wild animals and slow-moving vehicles in this setting.</td></tr></tbody></table>
