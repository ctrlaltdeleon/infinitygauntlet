Notes:

- Committee reviews a packet of data dependent on the interview.
  - The 4/5 on site interviewers are the ones who create the packet.
- Interviews are:
  - Noisy.
  - Inaccurate.
  - Arbitrary.
- Good interviewers are generous.
- Good questions are like onions.
  - Iteration on the same problem instead of multiple unrelated questions.
- More signal; less noise.
  - When the interviewee knows what they're getting into, the data becomes more reliable across candidates.
