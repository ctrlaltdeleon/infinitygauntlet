Notes:

- Blizzard is composed of 30%, game developers.
- The rest are support!
- Support is as follows:
  - Cinematics.
  - Blizzard Tech.
    - Web & Mobile.
  - Quality Assurance.
  - Business Operations (Tespa).
- Specialists are always more desired than generalists, makes the person and position feel special, as if they were made for each other.
- On a tech team it's composed of UI/UX Designers, Software Engineers, and Program Managers?
- Speak to Katiya and others for more information.
- Blizzard has outreached on Hackerrank!
