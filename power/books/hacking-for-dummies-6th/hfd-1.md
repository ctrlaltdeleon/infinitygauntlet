# HACKING FOR DUMMIES

## 1: Introduction to Vulnerability and Penetration Testing

### Types of Hackers

- Hackers. (external attackers)
- Malicious users. (external or internal attackers)
- Ethical hackers. (defenders)

### Hacker Definition

- Traditionally, it was someone who likes tinkering w/ software and hardware.
- Nowadays it means someone who attacks for personal gain (criminal hackers, crackers).

### Nontechnical Attacks

- Phishing websites.
- Dumpster diving for old working parts w/ sensitive info.

### Network Infrastructure Attacks

- Connecting to a network through an unsecured wireless access point attached behind a firewall.
- Exploiting weaknesses in network protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
- Flooding a network with too many requests, creating denial of service (DoS) for legitimate requests.
- Installing a network analyzer on a network segment and capturing every packet that travels.

### Operating System Attacks

- Exploiting missing patches.
- Attacking built-in authentication systems.
- Breaking file system security.
- Cracking passwords and weak encryption implementations.

### Application and Other Specialized Attacks

- Shadow IT, in which people in various business w/ own technologies can be tampered in the cloud.
- Mobile apps being more popular to attack due to being the social norm.
- Unsecured files containing sensitive information scattered across workstation and the cloud.

### Using the Vulnerability and Penetration Testing Process

- Let everyone know, business and software involved, that you're performing security tests or face charges.
- Test carefully, having back up plans to not hamper with production.
- Try turning off security to see how the system can be compromised if someone decides to turn off your security.
- What's the worst that could happen? Prepare for it!

### Tools to Use

- Ophcrack.
- Proactive Password Auditor.
- Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner.
- Cain & Abel.
- CommView for WiFi.
- Elcomsoft System Recovery.
- Metasploit.
- Nessus.
- NetScanTools Pro.
- Netsparker.
- Nexpose.
- Omnipeek.
- SoftPerfect Network Scanner.

### Executing a Plan

- Start with google to seek an organization's name, computers, network system names, IP.
- Narrow the scope, target specific systems.
- Further narrow by performing scans and other detailed tests to uncover vulnerabilities.
- Perform the attacks and exploit any vulnerabilities.
- Make sure the tests done have conclusions in where the organization is better armored or the effort is wasted.

### Moving On

- New security vulnerabilities continually appear all the time.
