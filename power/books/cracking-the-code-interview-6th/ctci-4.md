# Cracking The Coding Interview

## 4: Before the Interview

### Getting the Right Experience

- W/o a great resume there's no interview.
- W/o a great experience, there's no great resume.
- What can I do?
  - Take on a big collaborative project!
  - Get an internship!
  - Start something amazing!
- Professionals have the right experience to switch to their dream company.
- How to move to a position you want?
  - W/o revealing you're leaving, take bigger coding challenges.
  - Use free-time to build something passionate, for fun.
- Everything boils down to two things:
  - Are you smart?
  - Can you code?
- Always think about where you want to go in the end.

### Writing a Great Resume

- 1 page.
- Keep it simple and clear.
- Recruiters only spend about 10 seconds looking at a resume.
- Languages: Java (expert), C++ (proficient), etc.
  - Be sure to state language and level of experience as you feel necessary.

### Beware of Stigma

- Avoid Enterprise Languages because it shows you are "less skilled".
  - Visual Basic, .NET.
- When you're centered at being only a "C++" person, it comes off as "I can only do this".
- Certifications can be anything, depends on the company interviewing you.
- If all you know is 1 or 2 languages, it shows "Have they tried anything else?"
- In all, diversify your armory and show that you can speak more than 1 language.
