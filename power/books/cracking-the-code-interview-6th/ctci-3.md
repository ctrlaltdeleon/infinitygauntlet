# CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW

## 3: Special Situations

### Testers and SDETs (Software Design Engineers in Test)

- Prepare the Core Testing Problems:
  - How would you test a light bulb?
  - A pen?
  - A cash register?
- Practice the Coding Questions:
  - Number one reason why SDETS get rejected.
  - Do the usual coding and algorithm questions.
- Practice Testing the Coding Questions:
  - "Write code to do X"
  - ... & then after doing so
  - "Test the code if it functions properly"
- Note:
  - SDET position is easier than most, but a job to be stuck in.

### Product (and Program) Management

- Handling Ambiguity:
  - They want to see you not get overwhelmed and stall.
  - Tackle the problem head on.
- Customer Focus (Attitude):
  - Empathize with the users on how they will use the software.
  - "Design an alarm clock for the blind".
  - Ask questions to who the user is.
- Customer Focus (Technical Skills):
  - Technical knowledge not as necessary, but nice to have.
- Multi-Level Communication:
  - Able to communicate at all levels in the company.
  - "Explain TCP/IP" to your grandma.
- Passion for Technology:
  - Happy is productive.
- Teamwork/Leadership:
  - Most important.
  - How well do you work with other people?
  - "Tell me about a conflict with a team member".
- Note:
  - Vary wildly across companies and even within a company.

### Dev Lead and Managers

- Teamwork/Leadership:
  - Explicit evaluation:
    - How have you handled disagreements?
  - Implicit evaluation:
    - How you speak to the interviewer themselves.
- Prioritization:
  - How to make a team meet a tough deadline.
  - Asking the right questions to hit critical spots.
- Communication:
  - Evaluation of your personality since it's a leader role.
- "Getting Things Done":
  - Right balance of preparing and implementing.
  - Motivate people.
- Note:
  - Strong coding skills are almost always required.

### Startups

- Can be acquired by bigger companies.
- Interview process for this determines fate of company and workers.

### Interviewers

- Don't copy paste questions.
- Ask medium and hard problems to vary the performance cluster.
- Use questions with multiple hurdles than a single hurdle.
- Use hard questions, not hard knowledge.
- Avoid "scary" questions.
- Offer positive reinforcement.
- Probe deeper on behavioral questions.
- Coach your candidates.
- If they want silence, give them silence.
- Know your mode: Sanity, quality, specialist, and proxy.
  - Sanity:
    - Easy problem-solving or design problems.
    - Quick filter to check candidates.
    - "Find the answer to this riddle"
  - Quality:
    - More challenging problems.
    - Use these when algorithmic/problem-solving skills are top tier.
  - Specialist:
    - Test specific topics such as a coding language.
    - Problem is that if it's easy to learn, why bother asking?
    - Should be for skills that couldn't be learned in a day.
  - Proxy:
    - Not quite at the specialist.
    - Might not even need it.
    - Should be easy questions tailored to the position.
    - If you worked with JavaScript:
      - Why do we use === all the time rather than ==?
- Note:
  - Most companies mix and match these:
    - Ask specialist questions to non-specialists.
    - Hire specialist when not needed.
    - Need specialist but ask basic questions.
    - Ask sanity questions, not quality questions.
