# FRONT-END DEVELOPER HANDBOOK 2019

## 1: What Is a Front-end Developer?

- Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.
- The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
- A person enters into the field of front-end development by learning to build a website or web application which relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and commonly runs in a web browser but can also run in a headless browser, WebView, or as compilation input for a native runtime environment.
- Four run time scenarios:
  - Web Browsers (most common).
    - Typical browser you can find on almost anything.
      - Chrome.
      - Firefox.
      - Safari.
  - Headless Browsers.
    - A typical browser w/o a GUI, but the terminal.
      - Headless Chromium.
      - puppeteer.
      - slimerjs.
      - Zombie.
  - Webviews.
    - Native browser running on a device (e.g., iOS, android, windows).
      - Cordova.
