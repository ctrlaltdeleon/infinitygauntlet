- Exercises done from:
  - **Codility.** Gives online coding assessments that mimic those given by companies. Great for putting you in the zone!
  - **Codingame.** Gives you a video game feel. One of my favorites as it feels fun and enriching!
  - **Firecode.** Gives you problems that machine learn your completion. Also reviews previous questions to condition your habits.
  - **Hackerrank.** Gives tons of problems, albeit sometimes the website isn't complete in certain areas! Great discussion boards.
  - **Hour of Python.** Gives a great introduction and overall cover of Python. Great for learning key things, but doesn't go over everything.
  - **Leetcode.** Gives problems that strictly relate to data structures and algorithms. Curates company questions!
