Notes:

Similar to a Fibonacci solution!

Climbing to the top of the stairs takes any number of steps, but the steps taken can only be 1 step or 2 steps at a time.

How many steps does it take to reach "n"?

Time complexity: O(n). Single loop up to "n" is required to calculate "n" fibonacci number.

Space complexity: O(1). Constant space is used.
