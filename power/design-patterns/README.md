## Introduction

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems. They are not classes, packages, or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

## What types of design patterns are there?

### Behavioral!

- It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them.
