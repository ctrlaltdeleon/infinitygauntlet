# TYPESCRIPT

Contains all TypeScript exercises and the variance.

## Note

- Why TypeScript?
  - Strictly typed language as compared to the loosely typed, JavaScript.
  - Provides better maintainability overall.
  - "Would you rather take care of small silly errors or catastrophe during production?"
- Superset of JavaScript.
- Scales applications.
- `tsc filename.js`
