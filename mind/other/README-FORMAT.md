1. **`public/`**: What is distributed to the viewing software so everyone can see your greatest creation!
2. **`src/`**: All development usually occurs here. `src` is a convention for “source code”.
3. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells `.git` which files it should not track nor maintain a version history for. For instance, you shouldn't let anyone get your `.env` files. (These usually contain your API keys)
4. **`LICENSE`**: An open source license that protects contributors and users depending on the license chosen.
5. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) projects, which includes metadata (the project’s name, author, package names, etc.). This manifest is how [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) knows which packages to install for your project.
6. **`README.md`**: A markdown file containing useful reference information about your project. The file you're reading right now!
7. **`SOMETHING.lock`**: This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your package manager dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly)
