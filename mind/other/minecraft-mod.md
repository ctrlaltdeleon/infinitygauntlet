# Minecraft Mod

## Tutorial (Java)

1. Download the latest [Minecraft Forge Installer](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).
2. Install the Minecraft Forge Installer via Client.
3. Launch Minecraft.
4. Make sure to use the Forge Installer on the dropdown.
5. Confirm Minecraft Forge is running by looking at the bottom left of the start menu stating "Forge".
6. Click on "Mods".
7. Click on "Open mods folder".
8. Download mods from sourced websites such as [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com).
9. Drag the `.jar` files into the mods folder.
10. May need to restart Minecraft.

## Old Way (Java)

1. After step 5.
2. Close Minecraft.
3. `Run` (Windows Key + R) this filepath `%appdata%\.minecraft` to find the source files.
4. Within that directory, make a new folder called `mods`.
5. Download Minecraft Forge compatible mods.
6. Drag the downloaded `.jar` files into the `mods` folder.
7. Launch Minecraft and it should load your mods!

## Favorite Mods

- BetterPvP
  - Activates Iron Man mode (information everywhere).
  - I like to turn on the settings mode in the config file `%appdata%\.minecraft\config` then adjust in Minecraft itself.
- Biomeinfo
  - Shows what biome you're in.
- OptiFine
  - Optimizes Minecraft and makes mods compatible.
- Xaero's World Map
  - Press `M` to display the world map, set bookmarks, and displays a mini map with coordinates.
- WTHIT
  - Shows what you're looking at.

## Notes

- Fabric vs Forge?
  - These both are Minecraft mod foundation software and it doesn't really matter which one to choose.
  - I opted for Forge mainly due to familiarity.
- If Minecraft doesn't start...
  - One of the mods may be corrupting Minecraft, so best to insert mods one at a time.
