# CYBER SECURITY

## Spillage

- Spillage occurs when information is "spilled" from a higher classification or protection level to a lower classification or protection level.
  - It can either be inadvertent or intentional.
- To prevent inadvertent spillage:
  - Always check to make sure you are using the correct network for the level of data.
  - Do not use a classified network for unclassified work.
  - Be aware of classification markings and all handling caveats.
  - Follow procedures for transferring data to and from outside agency and non-g networks.
  - Label all files, removable media, and subject headers with appropriate classification markings.
- Never use or modify government equipment for an unauthorized purpose.
  - Don't plug in your own things.
- If spillage occurs:
  - Notify your security POC (point of contact).
  - Do not touch the files.
  - Secure the area.
  - Do not speak on the event as one would be treated as official confirmation by a government spokesperson.

## Sensitive Information

- Unclassified means that it is information that does not have potential to damage national security.
- DoD (department of defense) unclassified data:
  - Must be cleared before publicized.
  - May require application of access and distribution controls (known as handling caveats).
  - Must be clearly marked as "unclassified".
  - If compromised, could affect the safety of the government.
- Sensitive information includes:
  - For Official Use Only (FOUO).
  - Controlled Technical Information (CTI).
  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    - SSN.
    - DOB.
    - Security questions.
    - Biometric records.
    - Passport number.
  - Protected Health Information (PHI).
    - Health records.
  - Financial Information.
  - Personal Information.
  - Payroll Information.
  - Proprietary Data.
  - Operational Information.
- To protect sensitive information:
  - Properly mark all sensitive information.
  - Store sensitive data on authorized information systems.
  - Handle and store sensitive information properly.
    - Physical world, within locked areas and in security view.
  - Follow organization's policy for retention or disposal.
  - Comply with DoD Cyber Regulations outlined in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) for CUI and CTI handling requirements.
- When transmitting sensitive information:
  - Ensure all information receivers have required clearance.
  - Use encryption.
- To protect PII/PHI:
  - Do not mix personal life with work life, simply put.

## Malicious Code

- Malicious code can do damage by corrupting files, erasing files, allowing access to third parties.
