Notes:

- Standard Protocol.
  - Experience.
    - Is everything in the resume true?
    - Experience doesn't really mean a good game designer.
  - Game Ideas.
    - Game Designer VS Game Enthusiast.
  - Testing Interview Skills.
    - Good game designers who are bad at interviewing.
    - Bad game designers who are good at interviewing.
- What should someone ask?
  - "Are you a game designer?"
  - Not that simple though, but the core question we should ask.
- Game Designers create...
  - Systems.
  - Problem Solving.
  - Player Experience.
  - Game Loops.
- Game Enthusiasts create...
  - Ideas.
  - Design Critiquing.
  - Level Design.
- Bad questions?
  - "What's your favorite game and what would you change in that game?"
    - Too open.
  - "You need to design a new NPC for a game. Where do you start?"
    - What are you looking for with this question?
    - Confusing.
- Good questions?
  - "You're working on the game Rock Paper Scissors. Your creative director wants you to remove one of the three options giving the player only two to choose from. What goes through your mind?"
    - Bad answers...
      - "Why?"
      - "I don't like it."
      - "Convince to have them not do that."
      - "I'd give this to someone to solve."
    - Good answers...
      - "That would destroy the balance."
      - "One would always win or it's always a stalemate."
    - Great answer...
      - "Create a new game based off the 2-option system from 3-option system!"
        - Players can choose 1 or 2.
        - Each Team represents "Odd" or "Even" and depending on the total of the given number, the respective team wins.
  - "You're working on Far Cry and the creative director asks you to design a Tank Vehicle as an enemy encounter. Two points to keep in mind while designing this. One, open world NPC. Two, any playstyle can overcome this. What's the first thing that crosses your mind when given this task?"
    - Bad answers...
      - "Tank is easy, make it harder with more tanks."
      - "What if I drove the tank?" (Tangent)
      - "How another game does this is..." (Too much reference)
    - Good answers...
      - "Player needs to bring the solution, the solution is not laying next to the tank, make it a special encounter."
      - "What are all the different types?"
    - Great answer...
      - "The tank has weak moments where the drivers take a break."
        - It's not a tank, it's 2 guys in a tank.
- What about interviewing Game Directors?
  - High Level Direction.
  - Building Brands.
- Bad question?
  - "Where would you take the next Far Cry?"
- Good question?
  - "Critics say Assassin's Creed and Far Cry are becoming too similar in experiences. What's the root of the criticism, how are these brands different, and how would you help differentiate these brands in the future?"
- Takeaways!
  - Don't ask open questions.
  - Know good VS bad answers.
  - To test game designer systems, add or remove a mechanic from a known system.
  - Don't ask how, offer scenarios with problems.
  - Turn the interview into a design session.
  - Keep the conversation on track about solving problems.
  - Test job skills, not interviewing skills.
  - Keep reviewing the hiring process.
