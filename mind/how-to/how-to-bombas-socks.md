## 1: Introduction

- This is a simple guide of how to Bombas socks.

## 2: Performance Socks

- Performance socks all come with these features:
  - Airflow Venting.
    - Temperature regulating vents allow cool air to flow in, which helps manage moisture and prevent sweaty feet.
  - Hex Tec.
    - Performance breathability and moisture-management to keep your feet dry and comfortable.
  - Honeycomb Arch Support System.
    - Our Honeycomb Support System cradles the arch of your foot, like a firm but comfortable hug around your midfoot.
  - Seamless Toe.
    - We took the extra time to link the final seam on every pair of socks, creating a fully-smooth sock with no annoying bump.
  - Strategic Zone Cushioning.
    - Cushioning only where you need it most, with a thinner leg and foot than our full cushion.
  - Y-Stitched Heel.
    - The Y-Stitched Heel creates a natural cup around your heel made to fit your feet.
