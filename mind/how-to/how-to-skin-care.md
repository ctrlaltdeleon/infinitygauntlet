## 1: Introduction

- Having a core routine provides your skin with all the necessary steps to keep it clean, healthy, and protected.

## 2: Understanding Your Skin Type

- There are 5 types of skin types:
  - Dry.
  - Oily.
  - Seasonal.
  - Combination.
  - Normal.

## 2.1: Dry

- What is it?
  - Dry skin under-produces sebum, the skin's natural oil.
  - Sebum works to waterproof skin, preventing moisture from evaporating from your skin.
- How can you tell you have it?
  - If you wash your face and don't apply any products, after a couple of hours your skin will feel dry or tight instead of oily.
- What should you do about it?
  - Use gentle, non-foaming cleansers that remove as little of your skin's sebum as possible.
  - Use facial oils to help augment your natural oils.
  - Use heavier creams that lock moisture into your skin and prevent it from evaporating.

## 2.2: Oily

- What is it?
  - Oily skin over-produces sebum.
  - This is what causes more acne due to bacteria thrives off sebum.
- How can you tell you have it?
  - If you wash your face and don’t put on any products, your skin will feel oily and shiny within a couple of hours.
- What should you do about it?
  - Use low-pH foaming cleansers as high-pH gives a better environment for acne to flourish.

## 2.3: Seasonal

- What is it?
  - Dry in cold months, oily in warm months.
- How can you tell if you have it?
  - Same procedure with washing your face and noticing the outcomes, but at different seasons.

## 2.4: Combination

- What is it?
  - Dry and oily, in different sections of the face.
- How can you tell if you have it?
  - Same procedure with washing your face and noticing the outcomes, but at different sections of the face.
- What should you do about it?
  - Use your light, water-based serums and gels all over, then just use a rich cream on your cheeks.
  - Use a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) (for oily skin, degunks pores) on your nose and forehead and an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) (for dry skin, unglues dead skin) on your chin and jawline.

## 2.5: Normal
