## 1: Introduction

- A guide of how to build a PC.
- I highly recommend using `pcpartpicker.com` for reference.
  - Make sure the parts your pick are compatible with each other!
- Always consider your budget.
- Compare benchmarks when unsure with two parts of the same kind. (2 CPUs for example.)

## 2: What parts to choose first?

- Do you care about aesthetics?
  - Case.
- Do you want to do video editing?
  - CPU.
- Do you want to game?
  - GPU.
- Why not choose other parts first?
  - The three above are the most important as opposed to the other parts.

## 3: Case

- There are 4 different types of cases:
  - Small form factor. (Mini-ITX)
  - Mini tower. (Micro-ATX)
  - Mid tower. (ATX)
  - Full tower. (EATX)
- What to consider?
  - Aesthetics.
    - What's your favorite color?
  - Airflow.
    - Will the temperature of the whole computer be optimal and not overheat?
  - Cable management.
    - Will it be easy to organize the wires in the back?
  - Mounts.
    - Will you be having multiple storage tools?
  - Ports.
    - Do you want to use multiple USB ports?
  - Size.
    - How much desk space do you have?

## 4: Central Process Unit (CPU)

- What to consider?
  - Brand.
    - AMD VS Intel?
  - Generation, cores, threads, clock speed. (In that respective order.)
    - How much work will you be doing?

## 4.1: CPU Cooler

- There are a few different types of cooling methods.
  - Air.
  - Liquid.
- What to consider?
  - Amount of work done.
    - Is what your doing demanding from the CPU? (Video editing.)
  - Clearance.
    - Is this going to fit in the case?

## 5: Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

- What to consider?
  - Brand.
    - AMD VS Intel VS Nvidia?
  - Clearance.
    - Is this going to fit in the case?
    - Are you okay with GPU sag depending on the case you get?
  - Cooling solution.
    - Do you want 1 fan, 2 fans, 3 fans, etc.?
    - Do you want the GPU enclosed for visuals or open for performance?
  - Core clock.
    - Do you want to overclock?
  - Memory/VRAM.
    - How much work needs to be done with large datasets?
  - Monitor.
    - Will the GPU provide the necessary power and specs to make your monitor used at the full potential? (Think about this vice versa too.)

## 6: Memory (RAM)

- What to consider?
  - CAS latency.
    - Do you want performance? (Lower the CAS latency, the better.)
  - Frequency.
    - How much work will you be doing at once?
  - Memory channels.
    - What communication do you want with the RAM to the CPU? (2 sticks of RAM or more generally recommended to utilize dual channel.)

## 7: Motherboard

- What to consider?
  - Chipset.
    - Do you want a general motherboard?
    - Do you want a memory intensive motherboard?
    - Do you want to overclock?
    - What is the main goal for the motherboard?
  - Form factor.
    - Do you want a bigger board to support more features such as multiple GPUs?
    - Do you want a smaller board to be easier to work with?
  - PCI express slots.
    - Do you want to add GPUs, sound cards, WiFi cards, etc.?
  - Ram slots.
    - How much maximum memory do you want to have?
  - Socket.
    - Does the CPU you want fit with the motherboard and vice versa?

## 8: Peripherals

## 8.1: Headset

- What to consider?
  - Comfort.
    - Do you want an earphone/microphone combo?
    - Will you be fine with this on your head for long amounts of time?

## 8.2: Keyboard

- Different types for keyboards:
  - Mechanical.
    - Less force, but loud.
  - Membrane.
    - More force, but quiet.
- Different types of switches for mechanical keyboards (based on Cherry MX):
  - Red.
    - Soft, linear.
  - Brown.
    - Soft, tactile.
  - Blue.
    - Soft, clicky.
  - Black.
    - Medium, linear.
  - Clear.
    - Medium, tactile.
  - Green.
    - Medium, clicky.
  - Dark Grey.
    - Stiff, linear.
  - Light Grey.
    - Stiff, tactile.
  - White.
    - Stiff, clicky.
- Different types of layouts for mechanical keyboards:
  - 60%.
  - 65%.
  - 75%.
  - 100%.
- Different build parts for mechanical keyboards:
  - Case.
  - PCB.
  - Switches.
  - Keycaps.
- What to consider?
  - Size.
    - Do you want a small ten keyless keyboard or a regular keyboard?
  - Sound.
    - Do you want your key presses to be loud (mechanical), sharp, quiet, etc.?

## 8.3: Microphone

- What to consider?
  - Input.
    - Do you want a microphone to pick up everything or only just your voice?
    - Would you want to use a headset microphone or a separate dedicated microphone?

## 8.4: Monitor

- Different panel types for monitors:
  - Do you want your games to have the most accurate perceived color?
    - Get IPS, settle for VA, avoid TN, due to the viewing angles.
  - Do you want your games to offer the most immersive picture quality?
    - Get VA (the contrast adds more perceived depth), settle for IPS, avoid TN (similar contrast, worse color accuracy due to viewing angles).
  - Do you want the highest refresh rates possible?
    - Get TN, settle for IPS, avoid VA, due to response times.
- What to consider?
  - Form.
    - Do you want a curved monitor?
  - Refresh rate.
    - Do you want higher FPS with a 144hz monitor?
  - Response time.
    - Do you want to have fast reaction times? (Especially important in gaming.)
  - Size.
    - How big do you want the screen to big?
    - What's your desired resolution?
  - Stand.
    - How are you going to mount your monitor?
    - Will you have multiple monitors?
    - Will you have varying layouts for your monitors? (Stacked, horizontal, etc.)
- Use this to detect dead pixels.

## 12: Conclusion

- Thank you.

## 12.1: My Take

- I would go for case first since I'm a minimal person.
- Currently have NZXT H1.
- RGB is pretty, but matching aesthetics is my cup of tea.
