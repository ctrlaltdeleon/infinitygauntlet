  - With sleeves it's harder to mark cards in order to cheat.

## 3.1: My Take

- I would go for single sleeving if:
  - Playing just standard games with friends.
- I would go for double sleeving if:
  - Card value is great.
  - Card is foil (to prevent creasing of the card).
  - The deck you have is your final version, to reduce changing all the time.
