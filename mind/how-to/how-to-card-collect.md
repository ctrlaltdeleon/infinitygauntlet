# Introduction

- A guide of how to card collect.

# Sleeving

- Sleeving helps maintain the value of cards and causes them to be valid for play.
  - With sleeves it's harder to mark cards in order to cheat.

## Magic the Gathering (MTG)/Pokemon

- Single sleeving?
  - Dragon Shield.
  - Ultra Pro.
  - A lot of options are okay for this.
- Double sleeving?
  - KMC Standard Perfects.
  - Dragon Shields.

## Yu-Gi-Oh

- Single sleeving?
  - Dragon Shield.
  - Ultra Pro.
  - A lot of options are okay for this.
- Double sleeving?
  - KMC Mini Perfects.
  - Ultra Pro Eclipses.

# Conclusion

- Thank you.

## My Take

- I would go for single sleeving if:
  - Playing just standard games with friends.
- I would go for double sleeving if:
  - Card is foil (to prevent creasing of the card).
  - The deck you have is your final version, to reduce changing all the time.
