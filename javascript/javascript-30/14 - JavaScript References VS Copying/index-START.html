      // We get 200 100 because it's updates only the original one
      // We'd have to do "let age2 = age" again
      console.log(age, age2);

      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[1] = "Kerrigan";

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      // React way that I'm used to
      const team4 = [...players];
      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "AC",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // the problem here is that we update the old object when sometimes we don't want to
      const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      // assign(1,2,3)
      // 1 = take an empty object
      // 2 = take the said object design
      // 3 = fold in our own properties/values
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const captain3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const AC = {
        name: "AC",

          instagram: "acfromspace"
        }
      };
      console.log(AC);

      // by doing "dev.name = %NAME%", creates a copy
      const dev = Object.assign({}, AC);

      // now the problem is that Object.assign only goes 1 level deep
      // meaning to say changing dev.social.twitter will affect both dev and AC
      // there's a method called "clone deep"
      // here's a cheating way to do it where it strings the object and puts it back together again
      // this makes it a brand new object
      // "poor man's deep clone"
